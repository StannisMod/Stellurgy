/**
 * What being shot does to a shield, other than draining it.
 *
 * <p>Three claims, and the first two are a pair that only mean something together. A damaged emitter
 * <b>covers less ground</b> — the shell draws in and a stretch of hull it used to hold stops being
 * held — and it is <b>still billed for the field it was told to project</b>, because a shield that
 * got cheaper the more it was shot would make taking fire a way to save energy. Then the third: a
 * <b>neighbour that still reaches closes the hole</b>, and one that does not leaves it open, which is
 * nothing anybody implemented — it is what a smooth union of spheres already does, and the test
 * exists so it stays true.</p>
 *
 * <p>Everything here is driven through production's own doors: the damage arrives as a declared
 * impact through the damage engine, never as a probe writing a radius, and the coverage is read from
 * the emitter's own predicate rather than recomputed by the test.</p>
