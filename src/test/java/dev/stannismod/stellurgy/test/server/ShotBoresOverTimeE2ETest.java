/**
 * A round does not finish its whole life in the tick it touches a hull.
 *
 * <p>Before this, meeting structure was terminal: one call resolved a bore up to sixty-four blocks
 * deep and the round ceased to exist at the surface. Now it <b>keeps being a round while it bores</b>
 * — it is still there next tick, deeper and worth less, until it either comes out the far side or
 * runs out inside. That is one claim and it is the one worth a server test, because nothing smaller
 * can exhibit it: it is a statement about what is true BETWEEN two ticks.</p>
 *
 * <p>The second claim is the only body ordering the penetration law makes on its own: at the same
 * energy, the narrower round goes deeper. Not a depth — an ordering, because the depth is balance.</p>
