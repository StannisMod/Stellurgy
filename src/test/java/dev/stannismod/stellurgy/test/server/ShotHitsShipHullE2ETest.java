/**
 * A shot that meets a SHIP — the case the whole substrate exists for, and the one its world-block
 * tests cannot reach.
 *
 * <p>A ship's blocks are not where the ship appears to be: they sit at fixed addresses in a shipyard
 * subspace millions of blocks away while the hull flies around. So a swept segment computed in world
 * coordinates crosses <b>nothing</b> — the world frame is empty air where the hull visibly is. The
 * substrate therefore maps both ends of the segment into each candidate ship's frame, traverses
 * there, and maps the crossing point back out. Three conversions, none of which announces itself when
 * it is wrong: a frame error here is not an exception, it is a round that flies through a hull.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What makes this evidence rather than a coincidence</h3>
 * <p>Two controls, both asserted before any conclusion is drawn. The world frame at the target must
 * genuinely hold <b>air</b>, so a hit cannot have come from the world-frame traversal; and the
 * subject block must be undamaged at its subspace address beforehand, so "damaged afterwards" is
 * about this shot. The shot's own position after the crossing is then checked against the ship's
 * WORLD position — with the mapping-back-out leg deleted it would be five million blocks away in a
 * shipyard nobody can see, and every other assertion here would still pass.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Retired 2026-08-17, and worth saying why</b>: this used to assert that the round ENDED at the
 * hull. It no longer does, because penetration takes time — a round carrying more than the hull costs
 * is now correct to punch through and fly on, and a test that kept the old clause would be pinning
 * behaviour the game deliberately dropped. What replaced it says the same thing about the frame
 * without saying anything about stopping power: the round's budget fell by what the hull cost it.</p>
