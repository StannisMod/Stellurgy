/**
 * A beam is HELD, and what that means is that dwell is the weapon.

 * <p>A gun that throws rounds spends its energy in lumps at intervals, and holding the trigger longer
 * buys more lumps. A beam has no lump: it is a line with a power, re-resolved every tick, and its depth
 * grows for as long as it is lit. These pin that difference where it is visible — in the hole — and the
 * one behaviour that makes a starved beam readable instead of a stutter.</p>
 *
 * <p>Numbers are deliberately not asserted. Every one of them is balance and will move; what is claimed
 * is an ORDERING (longer dwell digs deeper) and a STATE MACHINE (dark, saving, lit again).</p>
