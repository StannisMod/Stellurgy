/**
 * How heat gets off a ship: the radiating cell, and the two things that decide how much it sheds.
 *
 * <p>Both are laws rather than tuned numbers, which is why they can be asserted at all. Area is
 * linear — twice the cells, twice the rejection — and temperature is QUARTIC, so a loop a hundred
 * degrees hotter sheds far more than twice as much. The difference between those two is the entire
 * reason a chiller is worth building later, so a test that could not tell them apart would be
 * pinning nothing.</p>
 *
 * <p>The third scenario is the clearance rule, and it is asserted from the loop's side: a blocked
 * cell must leave the loop's stored energy untouched, not merely report a zero.</p>
