/**
 * One round, one fresh wall, and it marks it.
 *
 * <h3>Written as a reproduction, kept as a pin</h3>
 * <p>This class was written to fail. Another scenario had a round fly through a stone wall with its
 * budget untouched, and the trigger looked like "the FIRST round fired into a freshly prepared
 * arrangement". Three versions of this test were built to reproduce that, each closer to the sequence
 * it was seen in — a single lane; two lanes prepared and built; and a preceding scenario firing down a
 * third lane and left in the air. <b>All three passed.</b> So the characterisation was wrong, and it is
 * recorded here rather than quietly dropped.</p>
 *
 * <p>What it leaves behind is worth keeping anyway: the plain property that a round fired once into a
 * wall it flies down the middle of comes out having marked it. Nothing else pins that on its own — the
 * shot suites all fire more than once, and the armour column test deliberately discards a round first.
 * If this ever goes red, the thing it was written to catch has finally come out into the open.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What IS established about the defect, and where</h3>
 * <p>The damage side is sound (a hand-fired impact at the same point bores four blocks deep), it does
 * not follow the impact kind (swapping lanes swaps which round sails through), it is not the lane and
 * not chunk loading. It reproduces only inside `ArmourAnswersByKindAndAngleE2ETest`'s own sequence,
 * which is why that class discards a round before the pair it measures — the reason is written there,
 * and the defect is carried in the bug ledger with everything ruled out so far.</p>
