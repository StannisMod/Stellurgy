/**
 * Non-player-sender guard contracts for the StellurgyCommandRoot subcommand tree.
 *
 * <p>Several {@code /stellurgy} (alias {@code /ar}) subcommands operate
 * on a player entity (held-item mutations, per-player gravity, teleport). When
 * invoked from the harness console (no player entity) they must refuse cleanly
 * rather than crash. The upstream merge replaced the WorldCommand monolith with
 * the StellurgyCommandRoot tree; the player-requiring subcommands now resolve the
 * sender via vanilla {@code CommandBase.getCommandSenderAsPlayer}, which throws
 * the unified "You must specify which player you wish to perform this action on."
 * message on a console sender. This class pins that negative contract.</p>
 *
 * <p>Positive (player-equipped) variants belong in testClient e2e.</p>
