/**
 * A console reports its network as dead once the network dies.
 *
 * <p>This started life as a regression test for a defect that turned out not to exist: the solver's
 * disconnected path does not notify controllers, but the console never depended on that push — its
 * own tick pulls the network state and falls back to a cleared readout when there is none. The test
 * was kept because the property it actually pins is worth pinning, and it was RE-AIMED at that: the
 * fallback path, not the push. It fails if the console stops clearing itself, which is the way this
 * display can really go stale.</p>
 *
 * <p>Recorded in ledger #260, including the wrong version — it was caught only by re-running this
 * test with the "fix" reverted and watching it pass anyway.</p>
