/**
 * A gun bolted to a ship, which is the configuration every other turret test cannot reach.
 *
 * <h3>The whole difficulty in one sentence</h3>
 * <p>A turret on a ship stands in the SHIPYARD — a fixed address millions of blocks from where its
 * hull visibly is — while the target it is given, and the round it fires, belong to the world. So
 * the gun holds its bearing in the ship's frame and converts at the muzzle: the point through
 * {@code toWorldFrameFor}, the direction through {@code rotateToWorldFrameFor}, plus the hull's own
 * velocity. None of those three announces itself when it is wrong; the failure is simply a round
 * that appears somewhere nobody can see.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What makes this evidence</h3>
 * <p>The round is located after the shot. If any leg of the conversion were missing it would be in
 * the shipyard, five million blocks out — and every other assertion here (the gun assembled, it was
 * charged, it fired) would still pass. That distance is the discriminator, and it is asserted
 * explicitly rather than inferred from a hit.</p>
