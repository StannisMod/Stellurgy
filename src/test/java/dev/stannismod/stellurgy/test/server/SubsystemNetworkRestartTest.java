/**
 * What a restart must give back — split by who owns it.
 *
 * <p>A subsystem network is deliberately not saved: it has no durable name, being "the blocks that
 * happen to be connected right now", so it is rebuilt from the world every time. That decision is
 * only sound if the rebuild actually returns the same network, and until now nothing checked it.
 * The settings are the opposite case: they live on BLOCKS precisely because a block has a name, and
 * so they are the things that must survive byte-for-byte.</p>
 *
 * <p>So this pins both halves against one restart: the ventilation graph comes back with the same
 * shape (nothing persisted it — chunk load re-registers the nodes), while the vent's zone priority
 * and the shield console's resistance bias come back with the same VALUES (their tiles persisted
 * them). A regression in either direction is invisible in a single-boot test.</p>
