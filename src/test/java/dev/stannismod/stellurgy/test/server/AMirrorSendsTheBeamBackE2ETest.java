/**
 * A mirror does not swallow a beam — it sends it somewhere, and somewhere is a place with blocks in it.
 *
 * <p>Mirror plating computes an outgoing direction for the beam it reflects and hands it back as a
 * deflection. For a long time nothing on the beam path asked whether the answer WAS a deflection: the
 * beam ended at the plating and the reflected energy was reported to a caller that did not read it. The
 * hull behind the mirror was protected, so from the defender's chair the armour looked right, and
 * three green tests over the thrown-round path — where deflection has always worked — said nothing
 * about it. What was missing had no observer at all.</p>
 *
 * <p>This gives it one. A beam meeting a plate square-on is reflected back down its own line, and the
 * only thing standing on that line is the gun that fired it. That is a real consequence and not a test
 * fixture: shooting a mirror head-on is a way to shoot yourself, and a player is entitled to find that
 * out. The assertion is deliberately about WHERE the energy went rather than how much of it went
 * there — the reflectances are balance and will move.</p>
