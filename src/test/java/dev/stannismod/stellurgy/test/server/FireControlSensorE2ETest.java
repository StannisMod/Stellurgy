/**
 * The step that was missing: <b>nobody names the target.</b>
 *
 * <p>Everything the gun system could do before this class needed a human in the loop — a linker, a
 * console, a probe. A battery could track what it was told about and could not notice anything. The
 * sensor is the block that closes that, and these two tests are the two things it has to be true of:
 * it finds a hostile on its own, and it cannot hold everything equally well.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Each test carries its own control</h3>
 * <p>"The gun fired" is worthless on its own — a gun fires for a dozen reasons. So the first test
 * watches the SAME battery and the SAME zombie with acquisition switched off and then on, and the
 * second watches the same pair through a listening sensor and then an illuminating one. Only the one
 * variable moves, and the state before it moves is asserted rather than assumed: an unbuilt gun, a
 * flat battery or a mount stuck at the edge of its arc is silent too, and none of those is what is
 * being measured here.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why the site is roofed and floored</h3>
 * <p>A zombie in daylight burns, and a burning body is a beacon — it would sail over any lock
 * threshold and turn the second test green for exactly the wrong reason. Building a box removes the
 * question rather than relying on the world's clock.</p>
