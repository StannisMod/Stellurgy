/**
 * The first time losing a fight costs anything but holes.

 * <p>A gun is shot at through the damage engine's own entry point — no probe writes a drive state —
 * and the mount walks down its ladder: it turns, it turns slowly, it seizes. The last rung is the
 * one worth having a test for: <b>a seized gun still fires</b> down the bearing it stopped at, which
 * is the whole reason the ladder ends in a named state and not in a rate of zero.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each claim is checked against the state BEFORE it: a gun that never turned, never fired, or was
 * already broken would satisfy half of this by accident.</p>
