/**
 * A damaged ship that is RELOCATED stays damaged, and leaves nothing of its damage behind.
 *
 * <p>The stage of a block with no tile of its own is held by position, in the world the blocks
 * occupy. A ship's blocks live at fixed addresses in a shipyard subspace, and a relocation does not
 * move them — it cuts them out, pastes copies at fresh coordinates and assembles those into a new
 * ship at a new subspace address. Every one of those steps is a place where a position-keyed record
 * can be left behind, and a hull that arrives pristine is a repair the player did not pay for.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why the count, and not one block's stage</h3>
 * <p>The subject is what the STRUCTURE carries. Asserting one known block's stage would pass a
 * relocation that carried that block and dropped the other eleven, and the damage engine spreads a
 * shot over whatever the ray meets. So the reading is the whole record set of the ship's own yard,
 * compared as a multiset of stages before and after — position-independent on purpose, since the
 * whole point is that the positions change.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The controls</h3>
 * <p>Two, and the test is worthless without them. The ship's subspace address must genuinely CHANGE
 * across the relocation, or both readings are of the same box and nothing was proven. And the source
 * yard must be EMPTY afterwards: a reading that only checks the destination cannot tell a carry from
 * a copy, and a copy leaves records at coordinates the next ship assembled there would inherit.</p>
