/**
 * What a hull does about WHAT hit it and HOW, rather than only about how much.
 *
 * <p>Until now a block resisted with one number and every arrival paid it: a beam dug like a slug, and
 * a round skimming a steel plate at five degrees dug in exactly as one arriving square-on. Three
 * claims here, and each is an ordering rather than a quantity, because every number behind them is
 * balance and will move.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Two columns.</b> Being boiled away costs far more per joule than being pushed through, so
 *       a beam buys much less depth than a slug carrying the same energy. That is not a nerf: it is
 *       what makes a laser buy precision and having nothing to reload instead of digging power.</li>
 *   <li><b>A price a faint beam cannot meet.</b> A stage is bought whole or not at all, so a beam
 *       carrying a slug's price for a block does not scratch it — and, keeping its energy rather
 *       than banking it, never will however long it is held.</li>
 *   <li><b>A graze skips off METAL.</b> And off metal only, so a player meets bouncing rounds where a
 *       player expects them and never off a plank wall.</li>
