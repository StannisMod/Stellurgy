/**
 * What a declared impact does to real blocks in a real world — the damage engine driven through the
 * same service a weapon will call.
 *
 * <p>Four contracts, each one a thing a weapon has to be able to rely on:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>an impact that meets a wall <b>spends into it and says so</b>: something is staged or
 *       destroyed, the report names how deep it reached and where it entered;</li>
 *   <li>an impact whose budget outlasts the wall <b>exits carrying the rest</b> — that is what lets a
 *       shot continue instead of being silently swallowed by the first thing it touches;</li>
 *   <li>the <b>same impact identity applied twice damages once</b>: retries are real on the resolution
 *       path, and double damage is invisible in a diff;</li>
 *   <li>a wall of tougher stuff <b>is not penetrated further</b> than a flimsy one at equal budget —
 *       the ordering the toughness table exists to express, pinned as an ordering rather than as any
 *       particular number, all of which are tunable.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Impacts are declared with {@code /stellurgytest damage impact ...}, which calls the production service
 * on the logical server; the stage of any block is read back through the same unified reader
 * production uses.</p>
