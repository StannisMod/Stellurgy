/**
 * What happens when a hull is opened, and what the ship can do about it (D127-9 / D127-6).
 *
 * <p>The three scenarios are one mechanic seen from three sides. A breach must cost the ship its
 * air — <em>lose</em> it, not delete it, which is what happened before: the flood-fill dropped the
 * room's cells and the gases went with them in the same tick, so a hull breach was free. A breached
 * zone must also stop drawing from the plant, or the ship answers a hole by pumping its reserves
 * into space. And closing a bulkhead must actually divide the ship, or "isolate the section before
 * you patch it" is not a move a player can make.</p>
