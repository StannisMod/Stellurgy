/**
 * What being too hot COSTS: the two rungs of the failure ladder that a ship can reach today.
 *
 * <p>The ladder's clause is an ORDER and a SUBJECT per rung, never a threshold. So every scenario
 * here reads the threshold off the server and arranges the world on the far side of it - a test that
 * named a temperature would be restating a tuned number instead of the rule that crossing it changes
 * what the room, or the drive, IS.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Crew damage - subject: the zone's air.</b> An overheated compartment presents one of the
 *       hostile atmospheres a scorching planet already presents, so the same suit protects against
 *       it and there is no second damage path. What is pinned here is that the room turns hostile
 *       and turns back, and that the gases only choose which variant of hostile it is.</li>
 *   <li><b>Hyperdrive refusal - subject: the coolant the drive is bolted to.</b> Free, and above the
 *       commit line: the pilot is told no and his capacitor is still full.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>What this cannot cover, and why.</b> The crew rung's damage itself is not observable on this
 * tier: {@code AtmosphereHandler.onTick} returns before the effect path for a connectionless player,
 * which is every player a headless server can supply, so a health assertion here would measure the
 * harness rather than the mechanic. The damage a hostile atmosphere does is pinned where a real
 * player exists - {@code test/client/VacuumAndSuitClientGroupE2ETest
 * .overheatedZoneAirHurtsAnUnsuitedCrewman} - and the derivation that puts the player in one is
 * pinned here and in {@code unit/AirStateTest}.</p>
