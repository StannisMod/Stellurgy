/**
 * What a calibre BUYS, inside the hull rather than on a tooltip.
 *
 * <p>A round used to be a line: whatever its declared width, it met one block per step and left a
 * one-block channel. So the choice between a needle and a slug was a number that changed how far the
 * same hole went. A body with width sweeps a cylinder, and the two claims here are the two halves of
 * the trade it sells — a wide round takes the blocks BESIDE the line it flew along, and it pays for
 * them by not going as deep. Neither is a quantity: both are orderings, because the depths and the
 * prices are balance and will move.</p>
 *
 * <p>The wall is a SLAB rather than a column, which is the whole arrangement: against a one-block
 * column a wide round and a narrow one are indistinguishable, and every test that has fired at one
 * would pass against a substrate that still treated a body as a line.</p>
