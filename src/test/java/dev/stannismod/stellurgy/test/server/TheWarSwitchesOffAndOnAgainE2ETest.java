/**
 * One switch, both weapon families, and a world that survives being switched.
 *
 * <h3>Why both families are pinned and not one</h3>
 * <p>The key this replaced gated the shot registry alone. A held beam has no record and never passes
 * through that registry, so a beam turret kept burning hulls on a server that had switched combat
 * off — and every instrument said the war was off. A switch that covers one family is worse than no
 * switch, because it reads as a promise, so the thrower half of this test is the control that would
 * have passed against the broken build and the beam half is the one that would not.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why ON again is the point</h3>
 * <p>The switch exists to be thrown on a world that has already been fought over and thrown back
 * later, so what OFF must NOT do is as load-bearing as what it does: damage already recorded stays,
 * and guns fire again afterwards without being rebuilt.</p>
