/**
 * Damaging a block that belongs to a SHIP — the case the whole damage engine exists for, and the one
 * its world-block tests cannot reach.
 *
 * <p>A ship's blocks do not live where the ship appears to be. They sit at fixed addresses in a distant
 * shipyard subspace while the hull flies around, so an impact arriving in world coordinates has to be
 * mapped into that frame before anything can be looked up, and the report's points mapped back out. In
 * an ordinary world the two frames are the same thing, which means every assertion fired at ordinary
 * blocks would pass just as happily with the mapping deleted — that is precisely why this test exists
 * as a separate class rather than another case beside them.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The arrangement has to MOVE the ship</h3>
 * <p>A freshly assembled ship sits at its build site with an identity transform, where world and
 * subspace still coincide. Testing there would be the same empty test with more steps. So the ship is
 * rigid-teleported far away first, and the test asserts <b>as a control</b> that the two frames have
 * genuinely diverged before it draws any conclusion from what follows.</p>
