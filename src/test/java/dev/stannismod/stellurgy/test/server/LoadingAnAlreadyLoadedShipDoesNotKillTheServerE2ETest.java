/**
 * Asking for a ship that is ALREADY loaded must be a no-op, never a dead server.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect this guards.</b> The physics mod's load pass asserts that nothing in its load
 * queue is already loaded, and raises {@code IllegalStateException("Tried loading a ShipData that was
 * already loaded?")} when one is. That throw leaves the world tick with nothing between it and the
 * server loop, so the whole dedicated server dies. Two loaded ships is not an error state — it is two
 * parties wanting the same thing, and both already have it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why it happens in play.</b> A tier-2 assembly spawns its ship already loaded. If a player is
 * standing near the pad, the world's own proximity pass queues that very ship for a load on the next
 * tick, and the assertion fires. The existing crossing and load e2es never see it because they keep
 * their observer far away during the spawn; a human who builds where he stands cannot.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why this test does not use a player.</b> That road is not reachable from the server tier at
 * all. The headless fake player is deliberately never added to the world (a connectionless
 * {@code EntityPlayerMP} in the entity tracker sends metadata to itself and NPEs), so it is not in
 * {@code world.playerEntities} — which is the exact list the proximity pass walks. A test driven by a
 * real player standing near a pad is a CLIENT-tier test. What is reproduced here is the same
 * precondition by a different road: a load requested for a ship that is already loaded. The
 * assertion the physics mod makes is about that state and nothing else, so the state is what this
 * pins.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The survival assertion comes first, and the still-loaded assertion is its control</b> — "the
 * server is up" passes trivially on a build where the load request did nothing at all, so the second
 * assertion is what proves the request was really served.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Its own server, per method.</b> While the guard is absent this does not fail an assertion: it
 * kills the server process. On a shared harness that would take every later method with it and read
 * as several unrelated failures.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on the server's real physics-mod presence; skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
