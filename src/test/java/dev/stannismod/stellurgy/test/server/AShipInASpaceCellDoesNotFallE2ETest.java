/**
 * A space cell has no gravity, so a craft released in one does not fall.
 *
 * <h2>The third case, and the only one nothing watched</h2>
 *
 * <p>The per-world gravity field answers three ways: a registered body scales the configured vector by
 * its own multiplier, a foreign or vanilla world gets that vector unchanged, and a space cell gets
 * ZERO. The first is witnessed by a craft that falls a quarter as far over a quarter-gravity body; the
 * second is the untouched path every other world already flew. The cell was pinned by nothing at all —
 * and it is the case a player spends the whole tier-2 game inside.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why "it did not move" needs a control, here more than anywhere</h2>
 *
 * <p>On a planet, a craft that does not fall is doing something: holding. In a cell there is nothing
 * to hold against, and <b>a craft in zero gravity is indistinguishable from a craft nobody is
 * simulating</b> — both sit exactly still, both report zero velocity, and the second is a defect this
 * mod has actually shipped: physics used to be switched on only after a craft had been flown once, so
 * a newly built ship hung in the air and read as station-keeping.</p>
 *
 * <p>So stillness is asserted only AFTER the same craft is shown to be under the solver's hand: it is
 * pushed, and it must translate. A build where the ship is inert fails that leg and never reaches the
 * one below — which is the whole point, because on such a build the stillness below would be true for
 * the wrong reason and the test would certify the wrong thing.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why it is ignored, and what would un-ignore it</h2>
 *
 * <p>The control leg needs a ship that can be DRIVEN, and this tier cannot drive one: a Valkyrien
 * Skies ship assembled on a headless server never becomes loaded, because with no client near it the
 * physics mod leaves it in the registry and never pulls its chunks in. {@code VSShipMotionServerTest}
 * carries the same limit in its own ignore reason and was the first casualty of it. Measured here as
 * a craft that answers a 4 blocks/s push with 0.0 blocks of travel, through three arrangements — as
 * the transit setup leaves it, plus a force-load, plus an unpark.</p>
 *
 * <p>So this is not a defect in the cell or in gravity: it is a test written at the wrong tier. It is
 * kept as executable documentation of the arrangement, and belongs at the CLIENT tier, where ship
 * load and drive already work — moving it is the work, not repairing it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Needs the physics mod: without it there is no ship and no cell to put one in.</p>
