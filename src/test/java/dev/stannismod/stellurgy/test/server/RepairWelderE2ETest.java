/**
 * The bottom rung of the repair ladder: one use of the welder takes one stage of damage off a block,
 * paid for in that block's own materials and in charge — and every way it can refuse is a different,
 * visible answer that costs the player nothing.
 *
 * <p>What is pinned here is the CONTRACT (C20 REPAIR-1, REPAIR-3, REPAIR-7), not the price list. The
 * assertions say that material left the inventory, never how much: the fraction charged per stage is
 * a tuned number, and a test that pinned it would fail the first time somebody balanced the game
 * rather than the first time somebody broke it.</p>
