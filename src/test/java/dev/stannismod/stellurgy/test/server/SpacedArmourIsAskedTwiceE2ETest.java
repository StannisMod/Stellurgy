/**
 * A round that comes out the far side of one plate is asked by the next one, in the SAME tick.
 *
 * <p>Spaced armour is the arrangement the reactive family exists for: two thin charges with air
 * between them stop more than one charge, because the second is asked only once the first is gone.
 * That claim was false for anything faster than a slow round. When a body passed through, the
 * substrate moved it the WHOLE of the tick's remaining travel in one step — not the distance the walk
 * had actually covered — so a plate standing inside that remaining travel was stepped straight over
 * and never consulted. The round arrived beyond it with its energy intact and the plate still
 * standing, unmarked and unspent.</p>
 *
 * <p>The two legs differ in ONE thing: how far the round can travel in a tick. Slow, the second plate
 * is inside the next tick's travel and gets its question either way; fast, it is inside THIS tick's,
 * which is the case the bug lived in. Without the slow leg a test could pass because nothing ever
 * reached the second plate at all.</p>
