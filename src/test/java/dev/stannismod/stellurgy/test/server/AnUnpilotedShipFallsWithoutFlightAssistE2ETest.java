/**
 * Flight Assist is the unmanned mode switch: with it ON an unpiloted craft holds, with it OFF the
 * craft is released and falls.
 *
 * <h2>Why this needs saying at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>A ship left at altitude with nobody at the controls used not to fall — and not because anything
 * was holding it up. The solver steps only bodies whose physics has been switched on, and that switch
 * was thrown by the flight computer only after a craft had been FLOWN once. A newly built ship
 * therefore hung in the air, and the state read from outside as station-keeping while in fact the
 * craft was not being simulated at all.</p>
 *
 * <p>So there were three states where the design has two, and the discriminator was "has anyone ever
 * flown this" rather than the pilot's own on/off choice. This pins the two the design names.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Both directions, in one run</h2>
 *
 * <p>"It fell" alone would pass on a build where a craft can no longer hold at all — which would be a
 * worse defect than the one being fixed, and invisible to a one-sided test. So the same craft is held
 * with Flight Assist ON first and asserted NOT to fall, then released and asserted to fall. The
 * control comes first deliberately: if the hold is already broken, the test says so instead of
 * reporting a successful fall.</p>
 *
 * <p>Needs the physics mod: without it there is no ship, and nothing to drop.</p>
