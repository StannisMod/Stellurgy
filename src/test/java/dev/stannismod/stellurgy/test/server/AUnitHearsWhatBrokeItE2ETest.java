/**
 * A unit is TOLD what happened to it — including, and especially, when what happened killed it.
 *
 * <p>The stage a block carries answers <em>how broken am I</em> and survives everything. It cannot
 * answer <em>what just happened to me</em>: a shell and a collapsing hyperspace window leave the same
 * stage behind, and a unit that only ever reads its stage can never tell them apart. So the cause is
 * pushed once, at the moment it is true, and these are the claims that makes.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The subject is a chest</b>, because a unit has to have a tile to hear anything and a chest is
 * the cheapest thing in the game that has one. What is being pinned is the DELIVERY, which is the same
 * for every unit; what a particular machine then DOES about being damaged is that machine's own and is
 * deliberately not here.</p>
