/**
 * The emergency dump: heat leaves the ship inside a lump of matter that is thrown overboard.
 *
 * <p>What is pinned is the SHAPE of the bargain rather than any rate. The dump takes heat off the
 * loop only once the ship is already losing, it charges the material it was given, and the charged
 * lump goes out of the port carrying the energy with it - so the loop is genuinely colder and the
 * matter is genuinely gone. A dump that ran while the ship was coping would be a cooling system, and
 * the contract forbids exactly that.</p>
