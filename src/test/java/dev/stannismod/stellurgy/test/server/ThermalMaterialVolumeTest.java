/**
 * How much substance a block IS, read off the block itself.
 *
 * <p>A slug's capacity and, later, a block's melting point are both {@code rho * c * dT * V}, and
 * this is where the V comes from: the block's own collision boxes, in the world, as the player built
 * it. Nothing about the volume is authored - which is why these scenarios are worth a real server
 * rather than a table lookup. The shapes are chosen to separate the two things that could stand in
 * for each other:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a <b>slab</b> is half a block, and its bounding box says so too - so it alone cannot tell
 *       the collision read from the outline read;</li>
 *   <li><b>stairs</b> are three quarters, and their bounding box says a FULL cube
 *       ({@code Block.getBoundingBox} defaults to it). This is the scenario that separates them, and
 *       a build that measured the outline reports a whole block here.</li>
 * </ul>
