/**
 * The failure ladder's last rung: past its material's own limit a block stops being damaged and is
 * gone.
 *
 * <p>Every scenario runs the real thing - a real coolant loop, charged through the same verb the
 * physics tests use, sweeping on the domain's own tick. What is asserted is the RULE (the substance
 * decides, and only past its ceiling) rather than any temperature, and the ceiling is read off the
 * probe rather than named here.</p>
 *
 * <p>The control leg is what makes the subject a measurement: the identical rig with a cooler loop
 * must leave the same block standing. Without it, "the stone is gone" is also what a test that never
 * placed the stone looks like.</p>
