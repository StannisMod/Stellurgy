/**
 * What the OUTSIDE does to a ship's heat: the incident flux, and the shield that thins it.
 *
 * <p>Three clauses, independent of one another. That every outside source arrives through ONE term —
 * shown by putting the same rig in two physically different environments and requiring its response to
 * track the one number both of them report. That where more arrives than a cell can shed the net runs
 * BACKWARDS and the ship heats regardless of its own temperature — with the control that a loop which
 * built no radiators does not heat at all, because a radiating cell is the ship's coupling to the
 * outside in both directions. And that a shield thins the flux and never removes it, asked with the
 * configuration demanding every last percent.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Most of this happens in a real space cell</b>, materialized from the overworld's own system,
 * because that is where the mechanic lives: on a world a coolant loop cannot be driven backwards at
 * all — the environment there is the world's own temperature, which is by construction below what the
 * loop sits at. A test that arranged the backwards case on a planet would be arranging something the
 * game cannot do.</p>
 *
 * <p>The star's STRENGTH is a setting and is turned up rather than flown to. How bright a star is
 * belongs to the universe layer; what a ship does with what arrives is this one, and the arrival path
 * itself — a real star, at its real distance, through the production registry — is what the space leg
 * of the first scenario exercises and measures.</p>
