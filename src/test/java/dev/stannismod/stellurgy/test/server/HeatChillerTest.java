/**
 * The chiller: two coolant loops with a heat pump between them, and the one clause a pump breaks
 * without anything complaining.
 *
 * <p>The ship's machines heat the cold loop; the chiller moves that heat into the hot loop and pays
 * electricity; the hot loop therefore runs hot, and radiated power is quartic in temperature, so its
 * radiators shed several times what the cold loop's could. <b>Nobody sets the hot loop's
 * temperature.</b> Energy piles up in it against its own capacity and the temperature follows — which
 * is what makes it a real reservoir rather than a number added to another number.</p>
 *
 * <p>What the pump costs joins the HOT side: the hot loop receives the heat PLUS the work, and only
 * the heat comes off the cold one. A pump implemented the obvious way moves `Q` and delivers `Q`,
 * which looks right in every readout and hands the player free thermodynamics.</p>
