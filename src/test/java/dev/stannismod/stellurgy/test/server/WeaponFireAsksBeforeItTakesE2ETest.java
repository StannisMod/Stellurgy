/**
 * Two promises a server owner has to be able to rely on, neither of which the mechanic made on its
 * own.
 *
 * <h3>A weapon asks before it takes a block</h3>
 * <p>Every protection system on this version - claims, regions, an admin's own listener - works by
 * cancelling a block-break event. A weapon that removed blocks directly was invisible to all of
 * them, so a turret was a way around the claim system rather than a weapon in it. What is pinned
 * here is the refusal: a guarded block that is fired on keeps standing, and the same block
 * unguarded does not.</p>
 *
 * <h3>An off switch ends what is in the air</h3>
 * <p>The shot registry is world-saved data. A switch that stopped stepping rounds without ending
 * them left them in the save, to resume whenever it was switched back on - a pause wearing the name
 * of an off switch.</p>
