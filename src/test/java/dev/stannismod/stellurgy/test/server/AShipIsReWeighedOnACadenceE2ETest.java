/**
 * A ship is re-weighed on a CADENCE, with no event to trigger it.
 *
 * <h2>Why a cadence has to exist at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>The authoritative recompute used to run only where the engine announced something: a craft
 * assembled, pasted, or loaded from disk. That covers every moment a hull's STRUCTURE changes
 * wholesale — and covers nothing else, because the other two halves of a ship's mass change with no
 * block ever changing. A tank empties over a burn. A crate is filled. Somebody steps aboard carrying
 * a stack of ore. There is no block event under any of it, so there is nothing to subscribe to, and a
 * mass model that only listens to events is one that reports what the craft weighed when it was
 * built.</p>
 *
 * <h2>What this pins, and what it deliberately does not</h2>
 *
 * <p>It pins the mechanism: after a craft has been assembled and the recorder emptied — so the
 * assembly's own recompute cannot be mistaken for this one — a full measurement runs anyway, on time,
 * with nothing at all happening to the ship. That is falsifiable in the strongest way available: with
 * the cadence removed the counter stays at zero forever, which is precisely the state this test was
 * written against.</p>
 *
 * <p>It does NOT yet pin the consequence — that a filled tank makes its ship heavier. Assembly moves
 * a hull's blocks into the ship's own shipyard address space, so filling a tank aboard means
 * addressing it there rather than at the coordinates it was built at, and no probe answers in that
 * space today. Recorded rather than quietly skipped: the mechanism above is what the consequence rests
 * on, and it is the half that could silently not exist.</p>
 *
 * <p>Needs the physics mod: without it there is no ship to weigh.</p>
