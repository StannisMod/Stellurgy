/**
 * What a shot IS between muzzle and impact: a record that crosses distance the world is not loaded
 * for, and that cannot be outrun by a wall.
 *
 * <p>Both properties are about the substrate, not about weapons or damage. The first says a flight
 * costs the host nothing but three vectors — a shot that quietly force-loaded a corridor of chunks
 * would pass every "did it arrive" test ever written and still be the thing this design exists to
 * avoid. The second says the integration is swept: at a step longer than a wall is thick, a
 * position-by-position simulation reports a clean miss through solid stone, and the faster the round
 * the more reliably it lies.</p>
