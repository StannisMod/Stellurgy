/**
 * Gravity is a property of the world a craft is in, and its MAGNITUDE is that world's own
 * gravitational multiplier: a released ship over a quarter-gravity body sinks a quarter as far in the
 * same time as one released over Earth.
 *
 * <h2>What was already witnessed, and what was not</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code AnUnpilotedShipFallsWithoutFlightAssistE2ETest} pins that a released craft falls at all —
 * on Earth. That leaves the whole point of a per-world field unobserved: every craft could be falling
 * at one standard gravity everywhere and that test would be just as green. A field that does not vary
 * is a constant, and thrust-to-weight, hover cost and stopping distance are all statements ABOUT a
 * varying field.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Two worlds at once, not one world twice</h2>
 *
 * <p>The two craft are released in the same window, in two worlds, and read separately. Doing it as
 * two sequential runs in one world — flip the multiplier, drop again — would pass equally well on a
 * build where gravity is a single global that the last write wins, which is precisely the defect this
 * mechanic exists to rule out. Two ships falling simultaneously at different rates cannot be produced
 * by any global.</p>
 *
 * <p>The measurement is a RATIO, and that is what makes it a contract test rather than a pin on
 * today's numbers. The solver adds {@code gravity x mass x dt} and then scales velocity by a drag
 * factor, so the fall is linear in the field and mass-invariant: two craft of different builds,
 * different masses, over bodies differing only in multiplier, cover distances in exactly that ratio
 * whatever the drag constant and whatever the tick rate happen to be. Nothing here needs to know what
 * one standard gravity is worth.</p>
 *
 * <h2>The premises are gated before the subject is measured</h2>
 *
 * <p>In order: the physics mod is present; the low-gravity body really carries the multiplier asked
 * for; both craft became ships; both HOLD with Flight Assist on; and the Earth craft, once released,
 * really falls. Only then is the low-gravity craft's fall compared. Without the last two, "it barely
 * moved" is the reading a craft gives when it was never simulated, when it was never released, and
 * when the field is genuinely small — three different states with one appearance.</p>
 *
 * <p>The hold is asserted as an ABSOLUTE drift, in both directions, on purpose. The solver and the
 * flight computer's feed-forward ask the same function precisely so that they agree; if the
 * feed-forward were left on Earth's field while the solver used the body's, a held craft over a
 * quarter-gravity body would CLIMB by the difference — which is most of the field — and a one-sided
 * "did it sink" gate would wave that through.</p>
