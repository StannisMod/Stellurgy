/**
 * A full pass over a ship's hull agrees with the running total the engine kept while building it.
 *
 * <h2>What is actually under test</h2>
 *
 * <p>A ship's mass is maintained two ways, and only one of them is cheap. The working path is
 * incremental — a delta applied as each block arrives or leaves — and it is correct exactly as long
 * as nothing is ever missed. The authority is a full walk over the hull, run at the few moments where
 * the incremental path cannot be trusted to have kept up: an assembly, a paste, a load from disk.</p>
 *
 * <p>This asserts they agree on a craft that was just assembled — the one case where they really
 * ought to, because the deltas were fed the whole hull moments earlier. A disagreement here is not a
 * rounding complaint: it means the two halves of the mass model are pricing the same ship
 * differently, and every derived number downstream (thrust-to-weight, turn rate, fuel per manoeuvre)
 * inherits whichever one it happened to read.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why the recompute count is asserted first</h2>
 *
 * <p>"No disagreement" is what a build with no recompute at all reports too. The counter separates
 * the two, and without it this test would pass forever on a build where the trigger never fired —
 * which is precisely the failure the recompute exists to catch, reproduced in the test itself.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why drift is read rather than thrown</h2>
 *
 * <p>The recompute runs inside the world tick. Raising an exception there kills the dedicated server,
 * and a dead server reports that the process exited, not that a hull was 4% light. So a disagreement
 * is recorded with its sign and read back here, where the failure message can carry the number.</p>
 *
 * <p>Needs the physics mod: without it there is no ship and nothing to weigh.</p>
