/**
 * Whether a player can see which way a turret is pointing.
 *
 * <h3>Why this is a client test and not a unit one</h3>
 * <p>A block cannot be turned — it sits in a grid cell at one of a handful of fixed orientations — so
 * a turret's bearing exists only as numbers on the server and as a drawing on the client. The whole
 * question is therefore whether those numbers arrive, and that is answerable only on a real client.
 * What is asserted is the state the renderer draws FROM (the client tile's own update tag), because a
 * renderer's output cannot be read from a test; what is NOT asserted is that the barrel looks right,
 * which stays a human's judgement.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The command travels, not the pose</h3>
 * <p>The client runs the same traverse the server does, from the command it was sent. So the test
 * waits for the client's bearing to converge on the direction the gun was pointed rather than
 * expecting a particular angle at a particular tick — the pose is the client's own arithmetic, and
 * pinning it would be pinning the harness's timing.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated by {@code forge.test.client.enabled=true}; auto-skips on headless CI.</p>
