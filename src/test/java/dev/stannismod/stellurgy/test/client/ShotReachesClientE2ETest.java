/**
 * Whether a fired round reaches the person it is fired near.
 *
 * <p>A shot is a server-side record: no entity, no chunk, nothing vanilla replicates on its own. So
 * "you can see the gun firing" is entirely a claim about a packet, and it is checkable on the real
 * client — the client's own tracker is asked how many rounds it is drawing, on the client thread,
 * after the server fired one. The control is the half that makes it worth running: a round fired far
 * enough away must NOT arrive, or the filter that keeps a battery off every connection in the world
 * is not doing anything.</p>
