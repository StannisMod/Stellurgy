/**
 * Where a friend is spared: <b>before there is a target, not at the trigger.</b>
 *
 * <p>A gun already declines to fire on somebody carrying the installation's code. This is the
 * stronger statement one level up — an ally never becomes a CONTACT, so their name is never written
 * anywhere a gun could read it, and no race, stale order or second console can talk the battery into
 * shooting them. The two are deliberately both there: the sensor keeps allies out of the list, and
 * the gun checks again at the trigger.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why this is a client test</h3>
 * <p>The credential is CARRIED, and only a player can carry one. A dedicated server has no players,
 * so the whole mechanic is unreachable there.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Asked about the player by name</h3>
 * <p>"The contact list is empty" would be the wrong question — a mob in a cave eighty blocks away
 * would answer it without saying anything about this player. The probe is asked whether THIS player
 * is a contact, and the control flips only the code they are carrying.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated by {@code forge.test.client.enabled=true}; auto-skips on headless CI.</p>
