/**
 * A beam a mirror turned is DRAWN turned, and not straight through the mirror that turned it.
 *
 * <p>The server resolves a bent beam as a path with a corner in it. Everything about that is
 * invisible from the client's side unless the corner crosses the wire: a beam sent as two ends is
 * still one beam, still drawn, still counted — and drawn as a laser passing clean through a plate
 * that is, in fact, reflecting it. So the beam COUNT cannot see this, which is exactly why it is a
 * separate scenario and a separate observable.</p>
 *
 * <p>The control leg is the ordinary beam. A gun burning into an iron wall must be drawn with NO
 * corner: without that half, a bug that reported every beam as bent would pass this file.</p>
