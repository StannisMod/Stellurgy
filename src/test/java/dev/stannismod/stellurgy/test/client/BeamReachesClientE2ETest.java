/**
 * Whether a burning beam is visible to the player standing next to the gun.
 *
 * <h3>Why this has to be a client test</h3>
 * <p>A held beam is not an entity, not a block and not a particle: it is a line the server resolves
 * every tick and forgets. Vanilla replicates none of that, so "you can see the gun burning" is
 * entirely a claim about a packet channel, and the only place that claim can be checked is a real
 * client. What is asserted is what the renderer draws FROM — the client's own tracker of burning
 * beams — because a renderer's output cannot be read from a test. Whether it LOOKS like a laser
 * stays a human's judgement.</p>
 *
 * <p>The control is the half that makes it worth running: a beam burning four kilometres away must
 * NOT arrive, or the filter that keeps every battery in the world off every connection is doing
 * nothing.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated by {@code forge.test.client.enabled=true}; auto-skips on headless CI.</p>
