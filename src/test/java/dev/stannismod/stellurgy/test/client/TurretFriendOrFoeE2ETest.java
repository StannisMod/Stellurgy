/**
 * Whether a gun can tell a friend from a target.
 *
 * <h3>Why this is a client test</h3>
 * <p>The credential is CARRIED, not held about somebody: an entity is friendly for exactly as long
 * as it has the installation's code on it, and the only entity that can carry one is a player. A
 * dedicated-server test has no players, so the whole mechanic is unreachable there — which is
 * precisely why it stayed unbuilt while everything around it was pinned.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Both halves, or neither means anything</h3>
 * <p>A gun that never fires passes "does not shoot friendlies" trivially. So the test makes the same
 * gun, pointed at the same player, fire once the code stops matching — the refusal is only evidence
 * if the shot is the control.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated by {@code forge.test.client.enabled=true}; auto-skips on headless CI.</p>
