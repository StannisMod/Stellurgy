/**
 * A ship-frame capture belongs to ONE body, identified by object identity - never to whichever
 * body happens to carry the same network id.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this contract has teeth.</b> Vanilla {@code Entity} declares equality by network id
 * alone ({@code equals} compares {@code entityId}, {@code hashCode} returns it), and in an
 * integrated server - singleplayer, i.e. how this mod is actually played - the client's
 * {@code EntityPlayerSP} and the server's {@code EntityPlayerMP} for one player are two distinct
 * objects in ONE JVM carrying the SAME id. Any capture store that matches keys by {@code equals}
 * therefore merges the two sides into a single slot: whichever side writes last wins, and either
 * side's release deletes the other side's capture. Measured in a 2026-08-03 playtest as a
 * ~5&nbsp;Hz capture/release war in which the server's own per-tick release of a SEATED pilot kept
 * deleting the capture his client had just installed - 142 cross-side deletions in 80 seconds, with
 * the two sides' install/release counts conserving only when summed ACROSS sides.</p>
 *
 * <p>The two sides run on different threads and own different halves of a body's movement; they are
 * not supposed to see each other's resolution state at all. This test pins that separation at the
 * one place it can be observed cheaply and deterministically.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>On the arrangement.</b> Installing a capture needs the physics mod, which is absent at this
 * tier, so the capture is placed directly into the store by reflection. That is scaffolding only:
 * every assertion below runs the real production predicates ({@link ShipFrameTravel#isResolving},
 * {@link ShipFrameTravel#aboardShipId}), and the first of them is a CONTROL - it proves the
 * arrangement installed something, without which "the other body sees nothing" would pass just as
 * well on an empty store.</p>
