/**
 * What a block is told when something hits it, and what it is allowed to answer.
 *
 * <p>Two claims. <b>The angle means what its name says</b>: square-on is zero and a graze approaches
 * ninety, in that direction — a ricochet rule written against a reversed convention would bounce
 * exactly the shots that should punch through, and nothing else in the game would contradict it.
 * And <b>an answer cannot promise what it has not got</b>: a deflection with nowhere to go is a stop,
 * and a stop carries nothing onward.</p>
 *
 * <p>No angle threshold is pinned here. Where a ricochet begins is balance; that the angle grows as
 * the hit gets flatter is the contract.</p>
