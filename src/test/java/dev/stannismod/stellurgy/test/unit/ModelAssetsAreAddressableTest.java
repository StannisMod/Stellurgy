/**
 * Every model asset AR ships must be reachable by the name the game asks for.
 *
 * <p>A block or item model is looked up through a {@code ResourceLocation}
 * built from the registry name, and 1.12.2's {@code ResourceLocation} lowercases
 * its path on construction. A registry name may therefore be written
 * {@code mirrorPlatingAluminium} — the lookup that follows is for
 * {@code stellurgy:mirrorplatingaluminium}. In a development run the
 * assets are loose files on a case-insensitive Windows filesystem and a
 * camelCase file answers that lookup anyway; inside a built jar the entry names
 * are case-sensitive and the same file answers nothing, so the block ships with
 * no model at all.</p>
 *
 * <p>The trap has been walked into twice. Once through a toughness regex written
 * in the case the block was declared in, which then matched nothing and was
 * indistinguishable from a table that was simply not needed; and once through
 * five blockstates and one item model shipped camelCase, found by a review
 * rather than by anything mechanical. Both times the dev client looked correct.
 * This test is the mechanical half.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What it cannot see.</b> Only the three directories whose file names are
 * derived from a registry name. It does not check that a needed asset EXISTS —
 * a block with no blockstate file at all passes here — and it says nothing about
 * textures, sounds or recipes, whose names come from string literals rather than
 * from the registry. The {@code models/**}{@code /models/} subdirectories are
 * excluded: those OBJ/MTL files are named verbatim by a field inside the JSON
 * that references them and are resolved by libVulpes' own loader, not by a
 * lowercased registry name.</p>
