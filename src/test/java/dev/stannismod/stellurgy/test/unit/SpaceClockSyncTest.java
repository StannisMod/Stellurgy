/**
 * The client's copy of the space clock, as a contract rather than as an implementation.
 *
 * <p>What is pinned here is what a CONSUMER may rely on: that an un-synced client is distinguishable
 * from one told "tick zero", that a baseline plus elapsed client ticks is the answer, that leaving a
 * server forgets the baseline, and that a later baseline WINS — including one that moves the answer
 * backwards, because the server's counter is the truth and a client that ran ahead of it is simply
 * wrong. Nothing here pins the field layout or the arithmetic's internal form.</p>
