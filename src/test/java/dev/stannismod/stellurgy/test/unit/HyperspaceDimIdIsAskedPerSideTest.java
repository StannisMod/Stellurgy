/**
 * <b>Which dimension hyperspace is has two answers, and they are not interchangeable.</b> The server
 * knows because it registered the world; a client only ever knows because it was told. Both live in
 * JVM-global statics that outlive a session, so the danger is not that an answer is missing - it is
 * that a stale one is confidently served to the wrong side.
 *
 * <p>What is pinned here is the SERVER's answer, which needs no world to express. The client's half -
 * that a reader on a remote world picks the told value, and that the telling is forgotten when the
 * connection ends - is observable ONLY through a world that reports itself remote, so it belongs to a
 * client test and is deliberately not faked here. An assertion routed through a world-less call
 * would read the server's field and stay green however the client's side behaved.</p>
