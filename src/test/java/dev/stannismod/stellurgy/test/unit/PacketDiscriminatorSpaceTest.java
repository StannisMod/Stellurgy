/**
 * The packet discriminator space is declared in one list, and a list that cannot produce a usable
 * wire mapping does not reach the channel.
 *
 * <p>This test fails if production breaks the contract that <b>every packet this mod sends has its
 * own wire discriminator</b>. A packet travels as a number: the channel's codec keeps id->class and
 * class->id side by side and validates neither, so two classes on one id leave decode handing every
 * one of them back as whichever registered last, and the receiver reads a foreign packet's fields as
 * its own. Registration is validated as a whole before any of it happens, so a broken space fails at
 * load rather than on the first packet that happens to cross.</p>
 *
 * <p>The discriminator VALUES are not pinned -- the channel allocates them in registration order and
 * appending a packet legitimately renumbers nothing before it, while pinning the numbers would only
 * forbid appending.</p>
