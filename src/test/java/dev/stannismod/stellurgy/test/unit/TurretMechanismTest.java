/**
 * What a commanded mount promises, independent of anything that shoots.
 *
 * <p>Three promises, and each test here fails only if one of them is broken: a declared rate is
 * never exceeded; a command the mount cannot reach is <b>visibly</b> saturated rather than quietly
 * clamped; and a drive that stops working leaves the barrel at a bearing the aim path can still read
 * as the truth. Nothing below asserts a step count, an internal field or how the angles are
 * interpolated — a rewrite that keeps those three promises keeps these tests green.</p>
