/**
 * A crossing / login-restore re-seat must put the rider back on HIS ship, never on a
 * neighbouring craft that merely shares the seat layout. The seat is re-identified by its
 * seat→flight-computer offset (the one binding that survives re-assembly), but that offset is a
 * DESIGN property — any two ships built from the same blueprint share it — while the candidate
 * seats are gathered by spatial proximity. So when the caller knows the ship's durable id, a seat
 * whose linked computer carries a different id (or none resolvable yet) must never match; two
 * ships parked side by side must each keep their own crew.
 *
 * <p>Pure unit: seats are real {@link TilePilotSeat} tiles (position + link offset, no world), the
 * ship-id resolver is injected — exactly the seam {@code CrewTransfer.matchSeat} exposes.</p>
