/**
 * What a body with WIDTH sweeps through, as geometry.
 *
 * <p>Two promises, and they are different from the ray's. The ray's promise — nothing between the two
 * ends is passed unseen — still holds along the axis and is inherited rather than re-tested here.
 * What is new is that a body which is wider than a line reaches things beside the line, that what it
 * has is DIVIDED between them rather than multiplied, and that no block is asked to answer the same
 * body twice. None of it mentions blocks, worlds or shots: a traversal that reported these voxels
 * would satisfy these tests whatever it was later used to look up.</p>
