/**
 * The hyperspace corridor has to read as travelling FORWARD.
 *
 * <p>A pilot in transit has no controls, no bodies in the sky and no number counting down, so the
 * corridor is the whole of what tells him the ship is moving — and a corridor whose rings recede
 * tells him, just as clearly, that it is moving backwards. That direction is not a matter of taste:
 * it follows from where the rings are, so it is checked here rather than eyeballed in a playtest.
 *
 * <p>How many rings there are, how far apart, how wide and how fast are {@code tunable} and are
 * deliberately not pinned. What is pinned is the two rules a viewer actually reads: rings approach,
 * and none of them is visible sitting on top of the camera.
