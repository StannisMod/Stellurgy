/**
 * Contract tests for the ship-relative point: the deck position that a durable aboard record stores
 * and a login restore reads back.
 *
 * <p>Two things are being pinned, and both are about the pair of directions AGREEING, never about
 * how either one is spelled. First, the round trip: a point stored relative to a ship's flight
 * computer comes back as the same point. A hidden half-block on one side only (the seat helper
 * carries exactly such a fudge) is a drift that repeats on every save/load cycle and would be
 * invisible to a one-direction test. Second, invariance under re-assembly: a ship is rebuilt into a
 * FRESH subspace on every jump, entry and descent, so a stored position is only worth storing if it
 * still denotes the same spot on the deck once the whole ship has moved.</p>
