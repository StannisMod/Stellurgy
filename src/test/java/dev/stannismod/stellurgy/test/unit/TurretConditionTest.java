/**
 * What a mount's own condition does to it, and what it is not allowed to do.
 *
 * <p>Two claims, and neither is a number. <b>A drive degrades in one direction through named
 * states</b> — it turns, then turns slowly, then does not turn and still shoots. And <b>condition
 * never overrules a decision</b>: a player's lock and an explicit fault outrank it, or a repaired
 * gun could never be locked again and a locked gun would come unlocked the first time it was
 * scratched.</p>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here pins where the rungs sit. Those are balance, and a test that pinned them would go
 * red the first time somebody tuned the mechanic without changing how it works.</p>
