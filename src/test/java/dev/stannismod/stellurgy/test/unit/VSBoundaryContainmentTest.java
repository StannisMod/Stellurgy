/**
 * Pins the physics-substrate boundary: the physics engine is a SWAPPABLE substrate that Stellurgy reaches
 * only through its own port, so {@code org.valkyrienskies} types must stay confined to the port
 * package and the mixins that weave into the engine — never leak into Stellurgy business logic (space,
 * crew, tiles, events, GUI).
 *
 * <p>Why a test rather than discipline: a stray engine import compiles perfectly and produces no
 * warning, so the violation is SILENT. It is also the invariant that decides how expensive a future
 * engine-version migration is — every business-logic file that names an engine type is a file that
 * migration would have to touch.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is an architectural contract, not an impl detail: it is asserted by ROLE (which packages
 * may name engine types), not by a hardcoded file list, so renaming or splitting a port class is
 * free while a new importer in business code fails.</p>
