/**
 * Contract tests for the durable "which ship is this player aboard" tag.
 *
 * Pins the persistence contract the login restore path depends on: a stamped record round-trips
 * across a save/load of the player's ForgeData compound; anything absent or malformed answers
 * {@code null} instead of throwing (this code runs inside the login path, where a throw is a failed
 * login and a half-read record is a player teleported somewhere he never was); a ship at the galactic
 * origin is still distinguishable from "no record"; and the shared ForgeData compound is never
 * polluted beyond the one namespaced key. Does not pin the tag's internal field names.
