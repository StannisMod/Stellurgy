/**
 * Contract for how a {@link TilePilotSeat} remembers its Advanced Flight Computer.
 *
 * <p>The seat and computer are linked on the launch pad, then the physics mod relocates the
 * whole craft into a ship — a rigid translation that changes both blocks' absolute positions
 * but NOT the offset between them. So the seat must store the computer as a RELATIVE offset,
 * not an absolute position; at runtime it recovers the computer at {@code seatPos + offset}.
 * These tests pin that relative-offset contract (the thing that makes the link survive
 * relocation) and its NBT persistence — no world, no physics mod, no client needed.</p>
