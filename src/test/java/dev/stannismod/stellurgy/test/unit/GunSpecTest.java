/**
 * What a gun's numbers promise the player who builds it.
 *
 * <p>The promise is that parts <b>add up</b>: two barrels are worth more than one, a part never
 * silently overrides what another contributed, and a build that is not a gun says so instead of
 * firing something worthless. These are the properties an addon's part depends on when it joins a
 * build it knows nothing about, so they are pinned here rather than left to whatever the first
 * caller happened to observe.</p>
