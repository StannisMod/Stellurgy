/**
 * An impact identity is handed out once, and the damage service's refusal of duplicates is only as
 * good as that.
 *
 * <p>This is a one-line property with an expensive failure. The duplicate memory answers a repeated
 * identity by handing the whole budget back, so a round whose identity somebody else already spent
 * bores nothing, marks nothing and flies on — through a stone wall, at full speed, with its budget
 * untouched. Nothing above it can tell that apart from a clean miss, which is why the property is
 * pinned here rather than left to be noticed downrange.</p>
 *
 * <p>What is deliberately NOT pinned: the numbers themselves, or that they are consecutive. The
 * contract is uniqueness and never rewinding; any two identities that differ satisfy it.</p>
