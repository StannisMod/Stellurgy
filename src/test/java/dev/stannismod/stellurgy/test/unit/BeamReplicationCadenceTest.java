/**
 * When a burning beam is worth a packet, and when silence is the right answer.
 *
 * <p>A beam is replicated as a STATE rather than as events, which puts it between two failures that
 * are both invisible in a dev world with one player in it: told too rarely and a client's drawing
 * either lags the gun or blinks out while it is still burning; told every tick and one gun costs
 * twenty packets a second on every nearby connection for a picture that is not changing. What is
 * pinned here is the shape of the arrangement — never while dark, always on a change, and often
 * enough that the client's own staleness timeout cannot fire under a beam that is still lit — and
 * none of the periods, which are tuning.</p>
