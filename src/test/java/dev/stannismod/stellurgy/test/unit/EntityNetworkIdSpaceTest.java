/**
 * The entity spawn-network-id space is owned in one place and cannot hand the same number out twice.
 *
 * <p>This test fails if production breaks the contract that <b>no two entities registered by this jar
 * share a spawn network id, and an entity nobody declared cannot be registered at all</b>. Both
 * halves matter: the id -- not the registry name -- is what a client resolves an incoming spawn with,
 * it is scoped to the mod container that three code bases in this jar share, and Forge rejects a
 * duplicate nowhere. A collision makes the client build the wrong class and then read the sender's
 * synced fields out of it, which surfaces as a cast failure in an unrelated class on a later tick.</p>
 *
 * <p>The exact numbers are deliberately NOT pinned. They are runtime-only -- NBT and the registry use
 * names, and both ends of a connection are this same jar -- so appending an entity legitimately moves
 * nothing and pinning the values would only forbid appending. What is pinned is the property that
 * makes the space safe. That the ids the space hands out are also the ids actually registered is
 * covered end-to-end by the server-tier resolution scan, which walks the real registry.</p>
