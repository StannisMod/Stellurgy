/**
 * The clause that keeps the emergency dump an emergency, checked as a RELATION rather than as a pair
 * of numbers.
 *
 * <p>C12 HEAT-17 says sustained throughput from ejected slugs must stay below the cheapest continuous
 * radiator tier: {@code E_slug / t_charge < P_radiator}. Written that way it survives rebalancing -
 * by us or by a modpack author - because what it forbids is a SHAPE (slugs standing in for surface),
 * not a value. So this test computes both sides from the config the game is actually running and
 * compares them; it names no temperature and no rate of its own.</p>
 *
 * <p>This became checkable only when the dump gained a charge rate. Before that the clause had no
 * {@code t_charge} to divide by, which is why it sat unpinned through three slices.</p>
