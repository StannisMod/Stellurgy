/**
 * What a shield block's condition is allowed to do to it.
 *
 * <p>Two laws, and neither of them is a magnitude. <b>A damaged node delivers less, monotonically</b>
 * — a shell that ate more fire never buys back capability. And <b>an emitter under fire covers less
 * ground</b>, visibly: the shrink is not allowed to vanish into rounding, and it is not allowed to
 * take the field away entirely while the block is still standing.</p>
 *
 * <p>Where the coefficients sit is balance and is deliberately not pinned here; the tests pass their
 * own so a tuning pass never reddens them.</p>
