/**
 * <b>A crossing that takes a ship's blocks away leaves nothing still bound to them.</b>
 *
 * <p>A seat dummy is an entity; the cut removes blocks. So the chairs outlive the ship unless
 * something retires them, and a rider left mounted on a chair whose ship no longer exists is an
 * inconsistent state that needs no measurement to be a defect — he sits in empty space, and the
 * dead chair goes on clearing the flight computer's pilot input every tick.</p>
 *
 * <p>What is pinned here is the MATCH, because that is where the whole thing can silently do
 * nothing: the decision is about where the SEAT is, not where the dummy is. A dummy rides at its
 * ship's world position, which for a managed ship is megablocks away from the subspace shipyard the
 * cut covers — so a positional query over the cut box matches none of them, retires nothing, and
 * looks exactly like a crossing with no riders.</p>
 *
 * <p>The boundary is "nothing comes back", not "a cut happened": the same cut also serves rocket and
 * station assembly, where the blocks ARE re-pasted and the pilot must stay seated. That is why the
 * retirement lives at the crossing and not in the cut.</p>
