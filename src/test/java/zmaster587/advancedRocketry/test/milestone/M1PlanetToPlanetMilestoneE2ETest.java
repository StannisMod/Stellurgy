/**
 * The first milestone loop, walked the way a player walks it: build a jump-capable craft, turn it
 * into a ship at the assembler's own screen, sit down in the pilot seat and fly it off the planet.
 *
 * <p><b>What makes this a MILESTONE test rather than another e2e.</b> Every earlier test in this
 * repo is allowed to take a shortcut somewhere — a probe assembles the ship, a probe mounts the
 * seat, a probe starts the crossing — because each one is aimed at a single mechanic and the rest
 * is arrangement. Here nothing a player does may be done for him. Probes may place blocks, seed
 * config and take readings; every ACT is the client's: the crosshair is put on a block and the real
 * use key is pressed, the assembler's Scan and Build are real button clicks on the real screen, the
 * seat is boarded by aiming at it, and the climb to orbit is a key held down. What the probes are
 * used for here is the opposite of driving — they are the instruments the test reads the world
 * with.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The legs, in order.</b></p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The craft is placed on a pad (blocks only — placing blocks is not an act a player performs
 *       through any interface a test can drive, and the fixture is the settled way to stand a
 *       structure up).</li>
 *   <li>The client walks up to the rocket assembler, opens its screen with a real use-key press,
 *       and clicks Scan and then Build. The completion signal is a VS ship existing where there was
 *       none — a tier-2 craft spawns no {@code EntityRocket}, so a rocket list would report success
 *       for a build that produced nothing.</li>
 *   <li>The client boards the pilot seat of the ship he just built, by aiming at the seat block and
 *       pressing use — and the seating is read back from the CLIENT, not from the server.</li>
 *   <li>He holds the vertical-up key until the ship crosses the atmosphere ceiling, and the arrival
 *       is measured from the client too: his own dimension changed, the ship is on the space
 *       ledger, and he is still in his seat.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>The one arrangement knob</b> is the orbit line, seeded to the config minimum so the powered
 * climb takes seconds instead of minutes. It changes how LONG the climb is, not what the crossing
 * decides: the trigger predicate is "the ship is above the dimension's orbit line", whatever that
 * line happens to be. Fuel is turned off for the same class of reason — a fuel-adequacy check on
 * the pad is a different mechanic with its own tests, and leaving it on would make this loop fail
 * for a reason that has nothing to do with the loop.</p>
 *
 * <p>Manual server + client lifecycle: the config has to be written into the game directory before
 * the server boots.</p>

        // approach. If the range never falls now, the assertion below says so before the descent
        // assertion gets a chance to blame the trigger.
        //
        // WHY THE DIRECTION AND NOT JUST THE RANGE — three refuted designs' worth of reason.
        //
        // The craft flies a STRAIGHT LINE on a held key (the pilot commands no rotation here), so one
        // key can only ever null its OWN component of the offset. A search that keeps "whichever key
        // still closes the range" never LEAVES the first axis it tried: once past that axis's closest
        // approach, the opposite key of the SAME axis closes the range again, so the two ping-pong
        // across the foot of the perpendicular forever. The residual they never attack is
        // 1024·sin(bearing) against a 512-block trigger, and the bearing is drawn fresh each run from
        // the ship's id — that shape reaches the body on about a third of the draws and orbits at
        // ~740 blocks on the rest.
        //
        // Working the three axes in TURN fixes that for a body that HOLDS STILL, and only for one.
        // The destination generally does not: a moon orbits its planet at up to 0.75 blocks/tick
        // (`6.545·√(g/orbitalDist)`, with the generator drawing orbitalDist from [100,199] and a
        // parent gravity of at most 1.3). The craft out-runs that comfortably — 240 blocks a burst
        // against at most 157 — but a blind search cannot SPEND that speed: while it takes ten
        // bursts to close the lateral component, the body's own motion re-opens the nose component by
        // more than the next pass can recover, and the range settles into a limit cycle around
        // 740-1100 blocks. Measured, not argued: that is exactly what the fourth design did.
        //
        // So the pilot does what a pilot does — he LOOKS. The direction to the body is not a
        // privileged reading: the cell sky draws every body along it, and since waves 2-3 the label
        // carries the range too. Each burst he takes the largest remaining component, flies about
        // half of it, and looks again; because the reading is refreshed every burst, a body that
        // moves is simply a body whose bearing has changed, and the chase converges for the same
        // reason the foot race does.
        //
        // The burst is a count of GAME ticks, sized from the component it is flying. {@code

        // 8-fork box than on a 1-fork box — it made this leg's geometry a function of machine load.
        //
        // What that does NOT remove: the ship is integrated on the physics mod's own wall-clock

        // ticks actually carries the craft still moves with load. The leg survives that by re-sizing
