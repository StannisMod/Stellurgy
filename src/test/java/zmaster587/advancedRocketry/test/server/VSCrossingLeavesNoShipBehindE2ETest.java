/**
 * A per-ship crossing MOVES a ship, so it must not ADD one to the world it left.
 *
 * <p>A crossing snapshots the source ship's subspace shipyard, cuts those blocks, pastes them elsewhere
 * and re-assembles a fresh ship there. One ship goes away exactly as one appears, so the number of ships
 * the source world holds is CONSERVED across it. Both legs assert that single invariant.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Two counters, each blind to one of the two ways a ship can be left behind.</b>
 * {@code vs ship-count} is the LOADED physics-object set; {@code vs ship-count-all} is the queryable
 * REGISTRY. A ship object left loaded but unregistered is invisible to the second; a registry entry left
 * behind with nothing loaded to collect it is invisible to the first. Both are read on every crossing, so
 * neither leak can hide behind the counter that cannot see it. The unregistered-object half is what this
 * class is aimed at; the other half has its own arrangement in
 * {@link VSCrossingOutOfAnUnloadedSourceE2ETest}, because it needs the opposite starting state.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Measured as a delta, never against zero.</b> The server is shared across this class's methods, so
 * each crossing is measured against counts taken immediately before it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The enabling condition is asserted, not assumed.</b> A ship OBJECT can only be stranded if the
 * source was loaded when its blocks were cut, so each leg asserts the source is loaded before it crosses
 * — otherwise a leg whose arrangement quietly drifted would pass while measuring nothing.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why arrival is checked by POSE.</b> The ship lookup behind {@code vs ship-info} returns the
 * nearest loaded ship at any distance, so on a build that strands ships it answers with the stranded one
 * and "a ship is managed here" would be true before anything arrived. Every arrival check therefore
 * requires the resolved ship to actually be AT the destination.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why nothing here pumps {@code vs load-ships}.</b> It is not needed — a ship is created already
 * loaded, and {@code permaload} keeps it that way for the whole class, so the loaded set fills itself.
 * It is also not safe: pumping a load while {@code permaload} holds crashes the dedicated server if any
 * registered ship happens to be unloaded, which a shared harness cannot rule out.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on the server's real VS presence; skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
