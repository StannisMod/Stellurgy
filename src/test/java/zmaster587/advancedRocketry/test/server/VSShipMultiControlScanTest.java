/**
 * One craft — one command authority, enforced at the assembly SCAN. A tier-2 build carrying more
 * than one Advanced Flight Computer (or more than one pilot seat) must be rejected with its own
 * error code before anything can assemble:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Two flight computers</b>: every AFC on a physics ship ticks AND is a force controller,
 *       so a second one — e.g. a scavenged block whose NBT still says "hold station" — fights the
 *       linked computer for the ship every tick. Unbuildable is the only safe state.</li>
 *   <li><b>Two pilot seats</b>: only the last-scanned seat is linked at assembly; a pilot in any
 *       other seat has silently dead controls. Passenger seats (the plain seat block) stay
 *       unrestricted.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both tests drive the REAL scan (fixture + one extra control block + {@code rocket assemble})
 * and read the scan status the builder GUI shows the player. The restriction
 * exists for the ship path; without VS the blocks are inert cargo.</p>
