/**
 * <b>A jump carries what is lying on the deck, not only who is sitting on it.</b> The half of JUMP-11
 * that is not a crew member: a dropped item aboard a ship is at the destination after the jump, and
 * it is aboard the SHIP there rather than merely somewhere in the cell.
 *
 * <h2>Why this tier</h2>
 *
 * There is no client in this contract. A dropped item has no client that owns its movement, reports
 * nothing about itself, and is placed entirely by the server — so a server test IS the honest path,
 * and a client e2e would only add a boot to watch the same server state through a longer pipe.
 *
 * <h2>Why an item rather than a mob</h2>
 *
 * An item has no AI. A mob that ended up somewhere else after the jump could have walked there, and
 * separating "was not carried" from "was carried and then wandered" would need a second measurement;
 * an item that moved was moved by something. It is also the body a player is most likely to have
 * lying about — the thing he dropped while building.
 *
 * <p>Gated on the server's real VS presence (run with {@code -PwithVS}); skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
