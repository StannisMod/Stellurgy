/**
 * {@code /time set} obeys the time-skip policy per world: it moves the clocks it is allowed to move,
 * leaves the rest alone, and says how many it left.
 *
 * <p>Vanilla's {@code /time} is not a per-world command — {@code CommandTime.setAllWorldTimes} walks
 * every loaded world and writes it — so a player on the overworld used to drag every planet's clock
 * with him. That is the arcade half of the day cycle, and past the atmosphere it contradicts what a
 * planet is: a body turning at its own rate.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Both sides of the flag, in one server</h2>
 * A test that only ever ran with the shipped default would be satisfied by a build that ignored the
 * flag and hard-coded the locked behaviour; one that only ran with it on, by the opposite. So the
 * flag is flipped at runtime — it is read at every use, not cached — and the SAME command is issued
 * either side of the flip. The pair is the assertion; neither half is one on its own.
