/**
 * C059 — wire write/read symmetry of
 * {@code EntityStationDeployedRocket}.
 *
 * <p><b>Contract</b>: {@code readDataFromNetwork} must consume exactly the
 * bytes {@code writeDataToNetwork} emitted — zero trailing bytes after a full
 * round-trip. Pinned for a representative inherited id ({@code TURNUPDATE})
 * plus the subclass's own {@code MENU_CHANGE}; the fix makes write a
 * structural mirror of read, so the dispatch-level property holds for every
 * id. Asymmetry means every inherited sub-packet
 * sent for a station-deployed rocket carries duplicate payload on the wire
 * (doubled bandwidth today; silent corruption the moment any field is appended
 * after the payload or a stricter codec is used).</p>
 *
 * <p>Driven via the {@code artest rocket wire-symmetry} probe, which
 * round-trips a throwaway (never spawned) {@code EntityStationDeployedRocket}
 * through the real write/read pair. {@code TURNUPDATE} is the probe default —
 * a self-contained inherited sub-packet (4 plain booleans, no external
 * state). The invariant pinned is {@code trailing == 0} / {@code written ==
 * read}, never a literal byte count.</p>
 *
 * <p>Repro history: pre-fix this test pinned the wrong behaviour (the writer
 * emitted the inherited payload twice while the reader consumed it once,
 * leaving {@code trailing == written - read > 0}); flipped to the corrected
 * contract with the C059 fix (Path B - the caller drops it).</p>
