/**
 * A ship that ARRIVES on a planet hot enough to set things alight must arrive WHOLE — with the
 * pilot seat its crew is about to sit back down on.
 *
 * <p>The contract is the player's: he lands somewhere hostile and his craft is still his craft.
 * What made it fail was that a structure arrives one block at a time, while the destination's
 * atmosphere judges each block the instant it is written. A pilot seat is cloth; the hottest
 * atmosphere band converts cloth to fire on contact; and mid-paste the seat that will end up
 * deep inside a sealed hull is standing alone in the open. So the seat burned before its tile
 * was ever restored, the arriving ship had no seat at all, and the crew was left standing in
 * space while their ship sat parked on the planet. It reproduced on roughly one landing in
 * thirteen — the share of generated planets that are that hot — which is why it read as a
 * flake for days.</p>
 *
 * <p>The test authors the hot planet instead of waiting for the generator to roll one, so it is
 * deterministic. Its POSITIVE CONTROL is the load-bearing part: a bare pilot seat placed into the
 * same atmosphere, at the same moment, MUST burn. Without that, "the ship kept its seat" would
 * also pass on a build where nothing ever burns anything, which is exactly the shape of test that
 * cannot fail for the reason it was written.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on the server's real VS presence (run with {@code -PwithVS}); skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
