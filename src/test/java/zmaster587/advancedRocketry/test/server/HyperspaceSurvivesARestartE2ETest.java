/**
 * <b>A restart is something a jump survives.</b> A ship parked in hyperspace is still parked in
 * hyperspace after the server has actually stopped and started again — JUMP-9's physical half.
 *
 * <h2>Why this needs TWO server JVMs</h2>
 *
 * The claim is about what survives a shutdown save and a fresh boot, and neither of those happens
 * in-process. An in-process "restart" — re-importing a record into a live manager — is the shape
 * {@code VSShipTransitPersistE2ETest} already uses, and its own javadoc says so: the JVM does not
 * restart, so hyperspace is never truly re-created and the physics mod's per-world data is never
 * re-read from disk. That is exactly the half this test exists to measure, so this class manages its
 * own harnesses rather than extending the one-harness base.
 *
 * <h2>What it measures</h2>
 *
 * Two things, in the order that makes a failure readable:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>The jump came back as the SHIP</b> — production's restore found the hull still standing in
 *       its lane and resumed the jump on it ({@code transitsParked}). A jump whose lane came back
 *       empty is still "in transit" and still arrives, by pasting the block snapshot it carries, so
 *       the count of jumps cannot tell a survived hull from a rebuilt copy. The snapshot path is what
 *       a jump silently degrades to when hyperspace does not come back, which is why this is asserted
 *       first.</li>
 *   <li><b>The hull itself survived</b> — the ship is still registered in hyperspace, from the
 *       physics mod's own per-world registry, read on a fresh JVM off the same world root.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Hyperspace's chunks live in a folder named after the world rather than after the dimension id
 * this boot happened to mint, and nothing wipes it: the ids differ freely between the two boots and
 * the content does not move.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why the arrangement hands the jump to production</h2>
 *
 * <p>The {@code artest space transit-*} probes build a PRIVATE transit manager, so a jump they start
 * is invisible to production's save and restore. Left that way, the hull this test parks looks to the
 * boot reconciliation exactly like a hull no record claims — and it is collected, correctly. So the
 * arrangement calls {@code transit-claim} before the shutdown: being claimed is the difference
 * between a ship in flight and abandoned debris, and only a claimed jump is the subject here.</p>
 *
 * <p>The record's own decisions — reclaiming the lane, adopting the parked hull, falling back to the
 * snapshot when the lane came back empty, disposing of what no record claims — are pinned in
 * {@code testUnit} ({@code ShipTransitManagerTest}); this pins the physical half those decisions are
 * made about, across a real restart.</p>
