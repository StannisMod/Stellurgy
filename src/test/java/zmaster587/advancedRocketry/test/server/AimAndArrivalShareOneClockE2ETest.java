/**
 * Ledger #164's contract, at the server tier: <b>a jump's aim moves with the SPACE clock and with
 * nothing else.</b>
 *
 * <p>The measured defect was a jump that arrived about 8&nbsp;000 blocks from the moon it was aimed
 * at. The standoff ring was innocent — it displaced the arrival by exactly its 1024 blocks. The aim
 * had been evaluated on a different clock from the arrival: it read
 * {@code proxy.getWorldTimeUniversal(0)}, whose client-side implementation ignores the dimension it
 * is asked about and answers with the world the player is standing in, and every dimension but the
 * overworld carries a clock that advances only while it ticks. The two had drifted 14&nbsp;912 ticks
 * apart, and a moon covers about half a block a tick.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why this cannot be the defect's own repro, stated rather than hidden</h2>
 * The defect needs a physical CLIENT JVM hosting the server, because that is the only arrangement in
 * which the sided proxy hands server logic the client implementation. This harness has no such tier:
 * every test here runs against a real DEDICATED server, whose proxy honours the dimension argument
 * and is therefore already correct. So what is reproduced is the DRIVER rather than the condition —
 * an accessor answering with a clock that is not the space clock — installed by
 * {@code artest space aim-clock lag}. The final word on the single-player symptom stays a playtest.
 *
 * <h2>The two legs, and why the first one is not optional</h2>
 * Leg&nbsp;B alone ("the aim did not move") is satisfied by an aim that never moves for any reason —
 * by a console that failed to resolve its body, by a probe that reports a stale field, by a target
 * that was null all along. Leg&nbsp;A moves the SPACE clock by the same magnitude and requires the
 * aim to move a long way, which is what makes leg&nbsp;B's zero a measurement instead of a silence.
 * Leg&nbsp;A fires on a broken build and a fixed one alike; only leg&nbsp;B discriminates.
 *
 * <h2>Why a moon</h2>
 * A planet-level body's in-cell law is static, so a stale aim costs it nothing and this test would
 * pass on any build. The subject has to be a body whose position inside its cell is live, which is a
 * MOON — and the test refuses to run rather than quietly pass if it cannot find one.
