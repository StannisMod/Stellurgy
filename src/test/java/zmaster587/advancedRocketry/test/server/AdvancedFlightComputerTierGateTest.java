/**
 * Tier-2 gate — an Advanced Flight Computer in an assembled structure decides
 * whether the launch pad builds an ordinary rocket or a movable Valkyrien Skies
 * ship. The two @Test methods pin the two halves of that gate, each gated on the
 * server's real VS presence so exactly one runs per suite configuration:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>no VS</b> (default suite) — the computer is inert; an AFC-bearing build
 *       still assembles a normal {@code EntityRocket}, with the computer captured
 *       inside it. This is the soft-dependency safety contract.</li>
 *   <li><b>with VS</b> (suite run with) — the fork routes to VS
 *       ship assembly, so NO rocket is spawned.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>What the harness deliberately does NOT assert: that the VS ship then fully
 * materialises, is pilotable, or simulates physics. VS assembly is async on a
 * physics thread and largely not headless-verifiable; the observable contract here
 * is the routing decision (rocket vs no-rocket), which is deterministic.</p>
