/**
 * Layer-0 spike: proves a pre-registered pool "slot" dimension can be rebound to
 * different on-disk cells at runtime by retargeting its chunk directory (via
 * {@code WorldProviderSpaceSlot.getSaveFolder()}).
 *
 * <p>A marker block placed in cell A must survive a rebind away to cell B (where the same position
 * reads as NOT that marker — a different, isolated world) and back to A (where it returns), while a
 * marker placed in B must NOT bleed into A. Gen-agnostic: persistence is asserted as "stone
 * present", isolation as "stone absent", so it does not depend on what empty space generates. No
 * Valkyrien Skies needed — Layer 1 ({@code VSShip…}) covers the VS-ship round-trip.</p>
