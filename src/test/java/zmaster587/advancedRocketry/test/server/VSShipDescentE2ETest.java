/**
 * E2E: does the tier-2 PLANET DESCENT take a ship in space across into a real planet dimension through the
 * built crossing? This composes on the entry on-ramp: a {@code with-pilot-seat} ship is assembled and
 * ENTERED into a slot cell (the proven entry path settles it in the {@code ShipLedger}), then the
 * production {@code DescentController.requestDescent} is driven for that settled ship toward the overworld
 * (dim 0 — a guaranteed real dimension with terrain). The descent runs the SAME generalized
 * {@code ShipCrossingService} the entry uses: it cuts the ship out of its space cell (releasing it from the
 * ledger) and pastes it, terrain-aware, into the destination dim, where it re-assembles.
 *
 * <p>Witnesses: BEFORE descent the overworld has no VS ship (entry cut the source out); AFTER descent a VS
 * ship is loaded in the overworld and the ship has left the ledger. The proximity TRIGGER predicate is
 * pinned separately + deterministically by {@code DescentControllerTest}; this e2e is the "the crossing
 * physically moves a settled ship into a planet dim" acceptance. Gated on the server's real VS presence
 * (run with); skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
