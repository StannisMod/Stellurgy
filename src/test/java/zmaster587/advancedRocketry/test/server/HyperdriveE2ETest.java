/**
 * The hyperdrive family in a real world: what a player gets for what he builds, and what the helm
 * does when he presses the key.
 *
 * <p>Everything here goes through production — the generator's own scan, the capacitor's own charge
 * arithmetic, the real jump gate, and the same {@code onJumpKey} the pilot seat calls when the key
 * is pressed. The probe places blocks and reads answers; it never computes one.</p>
 *
 * <p>No balance number is asserted. What is asserted is what a player can rely on while building:
 * more coils is more drive, more cells is more bank, more sinks is a shorter wait, a machine that
 * belongs to another ship is not yours, and the pilot is never charged for a jump that did not
 * happen.</p>
