/**
 * A compartment's air as a HEAT reservoir: it has a temperature, it has a capacity, and gas arriving
 * from somewhere else mixes into it rather than replacing what was there.
 *
 * <p>The mixing law is the one worth a test, and it is worth stating why the arrangement is lopsided.
 * The calorimeter rule and a plain average agree exactly when the two sides are the same size, so a
 * tidy 50/50 scenario would pass on an implementation that simply split the difference — which is not
 * the rule and is wrong the moment a small bottle is vented into a large room. The room here is
 * several times the gas admitted into it, and the expected answer is computed from the two pressures
 * the probe reports rather than stated.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What this does NOT cover, and why.</b> D266-4 speaks of zones EXCHANGING air, and there is no
 * such path in the game yet: the recirculator serves one zone, a duct stores nothing, and the only
 * place gas actually arrives from elsewhere is a separator's tank. So the rule is pinned on the one
 * live route, and the seam for the future one is correct by construction — the temperature of
 * arriving gas is a required argument, so a zone-to-zone mover cannot be written without deciding it.
