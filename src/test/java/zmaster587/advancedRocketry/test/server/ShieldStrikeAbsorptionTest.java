/**
 * P5 tier-1 (D134-2): the cooperative strike seam AR turrets will implement. A weapon declares a
 * {@code ShieldStrike} (energy + kind + ray) and {@code ShieldStrikeService.resolve} absorbs it precisely
 * through the {@code FieldFrame} seam. This pins the two contractual outcomes the seam guarantees:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a charged shield <b>fully absorbs</b> a strike it can afford (stopped at the shell, no residual,
 *       coil paid the cost) — and a shield with no charge is <b>no impediment</b> (the strike passes,
 *       nothing spent), the D134-2 "shield is a barrier only while up" rule;</li>
 *   <li>a strike that <b>outmatches</b> the shield is <b>gracefully penetrated</b>: the shield spends
 *       everything it has, the remainder passes downstream, and the shield drops toward zero — the same
 *       "shields fall" degrade as the kinetic path.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The strike is driven with {@code /artest shield strike ...}, which calls the real service on the
 * logical server and reports the result — no client, no mixin, no live weapon needed.</p>
