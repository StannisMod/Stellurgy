/**
 * An arrival's seat lookup must answer for the ship it is ASKING ABOUT, however close another craft
 * is parked to the point it asks at.
 *
 * <p>The lookup that seats a crew after a crossing takes a world point and scans the shipyard of the
 * ship it finds there. Resolving that ship by POSITION has no distance bound: it returns the nearest
 * registered craft in the world, which is the right one exactly while there is only one. A player's
 * entry to orbit has already failed this way — the destination cell held a second ship, the arrival
 * scanned that ship's shipyard, found no pilot seat in it (there was none to find, ever) and gave up
 * after 200 attempts with his own seat 51,200 blocks away in the same world.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Both legs are load-bearing.</b> The BY-POSITION leg is the defect itself, run as the control:
 * it must come back with zero seats, because that is what proves this arrangement can exhibit the
 * bug at all. Only then does the BY-IDENTITY leg's non-zero answer mean anything — without the
 * control it would also pass in a world where every lookup trivially found the seat.</p>
 *
 * <p>Arrangement: a seated craft and a seatless one, assembled 64 blocks apart, and both lookups
 * asked at the SEATLESS craft's position. Gated on the server's real VS presence; skips cleanly
 * otherwise.</p>
