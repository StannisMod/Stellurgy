/**
 * E2E: a jump with <b>nobody aboard and nobody nearby</b> must still finish on the pose realizing its
 * target coordinate — not in the arrival paste band.
 *
 * <p>This is the case the existing transit e2e cannot see. That test opens with
 * {@code artest vs permaload true} and calls {@code artest vs load-ships} while it waits, then asserts
 * the ship is VS-managed at {@code (0,200,0)} — the paste column. So it supplies the loadedness the
 * arrival is supposed to establish for itself, and it pins the paste band AS success. An arrival that
 * never reaches its pose passes it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here neither affordance is used: no permaload, no forced load. That matters because the real
 * deferral in an arrival is not asynchrony but a POLICY — Valkyrien Skies loads a ship only when a
 * player is within its load distance, and queues an unload every tick for one that is not — so an
 * unmanned arrival is precisely the case a readiness gate on "is the ship loaded" can never satisfy.
 * The observation side is safe to leave un-forced: the probe reads through the queryable ship registry,
 * which answers for an unloaded ship.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on the server's real VS presence (run with {@code -PwithVS}); skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
