/**
 * The space subsystem's clock is <b>its own</b>: it advances by itself and at the tick rate, no
 * world's clock moves it, moving it moves no world, and it comes back where it was after a reboot —
 * on a server where the subsystem came up and on one where it never did.
 *
 * <p>Until this landed the subsystem read the overworld's total world time. That answered
 * <b>zero</b> whenever the server or the overworld was not resolvable — a window every start and
 * stop passes through, in which a body's address, a transit's elapsed time and a capacitor's charge
 * were all silently dated to the beginning of the world with nothing logged. It also made aging the
 * universe for a test a write to a world the whole fork shares.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why this test owns its server</h2>
 * One leg has to drive the OVERWORLD's clock eleven days forward, which is precisely the hammer the
 * change exists to remove from shared servers. Doing that on the shared harness would leave every
 * vanilla and third-party {@code totalTime % N} gate — day cycle, mob spawns, weather — jumped for
 * whichever class ran next. A throwaway world directory can be hammered; a shared one cannot.
 *
 * <h2>Why the divergence is authored rather than waited for</h2>
 * On a fresh world both counters start at zero and both advance once per tick, so they agree by
 * accident and "the space clock ignored the world clock" would be satisfied by a space clock that
 * simply IS the world clock. Every leg below therefore drives the two apart by a magnitude no
 * elapsed-time slack can cover, and asserts the split it created before concluding anything from it.
