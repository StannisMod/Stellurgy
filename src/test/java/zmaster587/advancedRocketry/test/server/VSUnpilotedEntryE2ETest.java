/**
 * E2E: crossing OUT of an atmosphere is a PHYSICAL event, so it does not ask who is holding a key.
 *
 * <p>This is {@code VSShipEntryE2ETest}'s piloted climb minus one line — its {@code ff-input}
 * arrangement — and that difference is the whole subject: a pilot is the only thing that changes
 * between the two, and the outcome must not depend on it. The mode it protects is the mod's own
 * autopilot on the ordinary path: with no input the flight computer keeps commanding the retained
 * velocity setpoint, so a ship under cruise is physically flying while the deleted {@code flying} flag
 * read false for it — the one flight mode where nobody is watching was exactly the one that could not
 * leave a planet.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why this is its own class, and not a third method next door</h2>
 *
 * <p>It lives alone because of a defect in something else, measured 2026-08-11 and NOT in this
 * subject: <b>the THIRD {@code entry-setup} in one server boot cannot enter space</b>, whichever
 * scenario occupies that position. Three readings establish it:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>added as a third method next door, this leg fails <b>2/2 cache-busted runs</b> with
 *       {@code {"pending":0,"ships":0}} — a status that structurally excludes every settle outcome, so
 *       the entry was never requested;</li>
 *   <li>run <b>ALONE it passes</b>, so the unpiloted crossing itself works and the subject is
 *       innocent;</li>
 *   <li>before this leg existed the same failure landed on the <b>piloted sibling</b> instead — the
 *       class has no {@code @FixMethodOrder}, so JUnit's hash order reshuffles when a method is added
 *       or renamed, and the red follows the third POSITION rather than any particular test.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Narrowing the probe stack's slot set to its own slots (the binder used to see the whole pool) did
 * NOT fix it, which rules that hypothesis out by control. A server JVM is started per CLASS here
 * ({@code @BeforeClass}/{@code @AfterClass}), so a class of its own gives this leg a boot in which it is
 * the FIRST consumer — the home the bug ledger asked for rather than a red shipped or an order pinned
 * to hide which scenario lands third.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on the server's real VS presence (run with {@code -PwithVS}); skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
