/**
 * Every modded entity this jar registers must arrive at a client as ITSELF.
 *
 * <p>A modded entity is not spawned to the client by registry name: the server writes
 * {@code (modId, per-mod network id)} into the FML spawn message and the receiving client resolves
 * that pair back to a class by taking the FIRST registration under that mod carrying the id. Our
 * jar hosts more than one code base under ONE mod container — the physics engine and the shield
 * mod are vendored in rather than loaded as separate mods — so their entity numbering shares a
 * single space with this mod's own. Two entities that pick the same number are indistinguishable
 * on the wire, and the loser is built as the winner's class and then fed the sender's
 * data-watcher slots by index, with no type check on the path: the first reader of a slot casts
 * and takes the whole client down.</p>
 *
 * <p>The probe performs exactly the client's resolution for every registered entity and reports
 * the ones that come back as a different registration. This test is the numbering's only guard —
 * nothing in Forge rejects a duplicate, and the failure is silent until a player is near one of
 * the entities involved.</p>
