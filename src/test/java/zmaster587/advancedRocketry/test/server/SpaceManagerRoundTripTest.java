/**
 * Server e2e for the {@code SpaceManager} controller driving the real world lifecycle through
 * {@code PoolSlotBinder}: proves the two-tier design end to end against live dimensions.
 *
 * <p>In one synchronous probe (a pool of one slot, so every fresh materialize forces an eviction):
 * a dirty cell's marker block survives eviction and reload via the manager (store round-trip); a
 * clean cell loaded into the freed slot is isolated (does not see the other cell's marker); and a
 * garbage-collected idle stored cell has its on-disk folder actually deleted. Gen-agnostic:
 * persistence is asserted as "marker present", isolation as "marker absent".</p>
