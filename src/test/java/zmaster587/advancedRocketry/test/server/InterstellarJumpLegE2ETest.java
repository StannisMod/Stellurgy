/**
 * Does a jump to ANOTHER STAR SYSTEM fly, and how long does it take?
 *
 * <p>Every jump ever flown here has been a hop of one sector. The distance between two real systems
 * is three orders of magnitude larger — the generator partitions space into 512-cell super-cells and
 * a cell is 4M blocks — so the interstellar leg has never been exercised: not the integrator over
 * thousands of ticks, not the arrival into a cell that far out, not the ledger address it settles at.
 * Nothing in the gate refuses it; nobody had flown it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The control is in the run.</b> The same ship jumps one sector first. That leg must arrive
 * almost immediately — a hop is four ticks at the baseline speed — and it establishes that the
 * arrangement (entry stack, ledger, arrival, the poll that reads them) works at all. Only then does
 * the far leg get to speak: a red near leg indicts the scaffolding and says nothing about distance.
 * The two legs also stand as each other's measurement — the same ship, the same stack, the same
 * instrument, one variable changed.</p>
 *
 * <p>What is asserted is SHAPE, never a duration: that the far leg arrives at the cell it was aimed
 * at, and that it takes strictly longer than the hop. The tick counts it prints are balance
 * readings — speed, spacing and cell size are all `tunable` — and a test that pinned one would go
 * red on a rebalance with nothing broken.</p>
