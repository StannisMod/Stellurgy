/**
 * The assembler links a built navigation computer to the ship it is part of.
 *
 * <p>The link is what makes the computer THIS ship's — the jump gate finds a ship's navigation through
 * its flight computer, so a computer welded into the hull but never linked would leave the finished
 * ship unable to jump for no reason the player can see.</p>
 *
 * <p>Needs the physics mod: the link is set on the tier-2 assembly path, which only runs when a real
 * ship is being made.</p>
