/**
 * P2 (D134-3/D134-4): the emitter is the shield's per-zone regeneration organ, with a finite,
 * tier-scaled throughput, and zones drop/regenerate independently. These pin the player-visible
 * contracts on the vendored AFFS network:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Throughput is tier-scaled.</b> A higher-tier emitter recharges its zone faster than a
 *       lower-tier one — the progression hook of D134-3.</li>
 *   <li><b>Regeneration is throughput-capped.</b> With a bulk source holding far more than one tick's
 *       worth, a single emitter still refills its coil by no more than its throughput per solve — a big
 *       generator/accumulator behind a small emitter cannot over-regenerate.</li>
 *   <li><b>Zones drop independently.</b> A starved emitter collapses (its field powers off and drops
 *       out of the composite surface) while a separately-fed emitter holds — there is no cross-zone
 *       auto-rescue (D134-4).</li>
 *   <li><b>Responsible area = nearest emitter.</b> A surface point is owned by its nearest active
 *       emitter (the D134-3 Voronoi partition), exposed through {@code /artest shield zone}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The network solve lives in a {@code WorldTickEvent} handler a command cannot advance from inside a
 * server tick; the test drives it deterministically via {@code /artest shield tick}. Emitter
 * self-drain (passive maintenance) happens in the emitter's own {@code update()}, advanced with
 * {@code /artest tile force-tick}.</p>
