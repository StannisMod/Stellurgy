/**
 * The air-intake duct: the block that finally connects the part of a ship people live in to the part
 * that throws heat overboard.
 *
 * <p>A chiller alone talks only to coolant. Bolt a duct to its cold face and it breathes a room
 * instead — taking heat out of that room's air, paying electricity, and delivering both into the hot
 * loop where the radiators are. So the two assertions are a pair: the room must actually get colder,
 * and the loop must receive exactly what left the room PLUS the work that moved it. Either one alone
 * would pass on a machine that invented energy or on one that quietly destroyed it.</p>
 *
 * <p>An unpowered chiller is the control, and it is the honest one: it is the same rig in the same
 * place, differing only in the thing under test.</p>
