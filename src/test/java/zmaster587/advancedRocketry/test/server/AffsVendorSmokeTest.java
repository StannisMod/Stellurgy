/**
 * Registration smoke for the vendored Advanced Force Field System (the shield subsystem
 * folded into AR's single mod container).
 *
 * <p>The merge's real risk is <em>silent</em>: if the guest's
 * {@code @Mod.EventBusSubscriber} no longer resolves to a loaded mod container, its
 * {@code RegistryEvent.Register} handlers never fire and the AFFS blocks are simply
 * absent — the server still boots green. This test refuses that trap: a block that is
 * not in the registry cannot be placed, so a successful {@code /artest place} of each
 * AFFS block is direct proof it registered under AR's container with the {@code affs:}
 * domain preserved.</p>
