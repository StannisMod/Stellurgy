/**
 * Server e2e for the contract that makes a cell&rarr;slot binding usable: <b>while a cell is bound to
 * a slot, that slot has a world</b>. Every consumer that needs a ship's dimension derives it from the
 * binding, so a binding whose world has gone hands out a dimension id with nothing behind it, and the
 * caller reads that as "the ship is not there" — which is how a jump into a cell the ship had left
 * earlier could fail its arrival two hundred times in silence.
 *
 * <p>A cell with no occupant stays bound on purpose (eviction is lazy, so a revisit is cheap), and on
 * 1.12.2 Forge removes a player-less, chunk-less dimension at tick end without any call through the
 * pool's own load/unload seam. Two defences, one leg each:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>The pool holds its worlds</b> — Forge cannot take a slot a cell is bound to.</li>
 *   <li><b>The controller repairs a binding anyway</b> — if the world goes by any other route, the next
 *       materialize re-initialises the slot against the same cell instead of handing out a dead id.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Leg order matters. The unheld leg runs FIRST and its world really does disappear: that is the
 * positive control which makes the held leg's "the world is still there" a measurement rather than a
 * sentence that would also pass if Forge's sweep were absent, or if this test's stimulus never reached
 * it. This is also deliberately the only space probe sequence that spans TICKS — the others collapse
 * into one synchronous call so the sweep cannot intervene, which is why none of them can see it.</p>
