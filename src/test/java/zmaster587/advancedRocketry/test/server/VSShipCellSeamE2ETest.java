/**
 * E2E: a ship flown out through its cell's face ARRIVES IN THE NEIGHBOUR, and its ledger row names the
 * cell it is actually in.
 *
 * <p>Before the seam existed, such a ship was neither stopped nor carried: the pose kept going while
 * the ledger report saturated at the boundary, leaving the ship in one place and named in another —
 * unable to descend, refused its jumps, and no longer protecting the cell it was really in.</p>
 *
 * <p>The arrangement uses the REAL on-ramp to get a ship legitimately settled in a cell (assemble,
 * hold a throttle, climb past the ceiling, let the flight computer's own tick call entry), then moves
 * it past the face and drives {@code SpaceSubsystem.cellCrossings().requestCarry()} — production code, through
 * a probe verb. The crossing itself is the shared one every other crossing uses.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What this test does NOT cover, stated rather than implied:</b> the trigger wiring inside
 * {@code TileAdvancedFlightComputer}. A headless slot world has no player and no ticking chunks, so
 * its tiles do not tick and no e2e here can observe that call — the same limit the descent e2e has
 * (it drives {@code space descent-begin} and says so). WHEN a carry fires is pinned deterministically
 * by {@code CellSeamTest}; the one link neither covers is the two lines in the tile that join them.</p>
 *
 * <p>Witnesses, in order: the ledger names the +X neighbour and no other cell; the ship arrives
 * {@code REENTRY_DEPTH} INSIDE that neighbour's opposite face rather than on it; and it stays there —
 * a ship placed on the face would be one drift away from crossing straight back, which is the whole
 * content of the hysteresis. CONTROL: the pre-move ledger read is asserted to name the source cell, so
 * the later change is a real observation rather than a first reading.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on the server's real VS presence (run with {@code -PwithVS}); skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
