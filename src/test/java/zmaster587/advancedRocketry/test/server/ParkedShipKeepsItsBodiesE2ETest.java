/**
 * Ledger #143's own repro, at the server tier, against the real universe registry: <b>a body does not
 * leave its cell because time passed.</b>
 *
 * <p>The measured defect was a pilot sitting still in a cell that held six bodies and watching all six
 * disappear 84 seconds later. The cause was that a body's address was re-derived from its LIVE orbital
 * angle on every query, so the address moved with the world clock and membership of a cell expired
 * while its occupant was still there. This ages the universe by roughly eleven and a half real-time
 * days and asks the registry the same question twice.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not satisfiable by a universe that does not move</h2>
 * A name that never changes is trivially still the same name if nothing else changed either, so the
 * invariance below would mean nothing on its own. The control is the cell's FRAME: {@code artest space
 * frame} reports where the cell actually IS at the current clock &mdash; a cell rides the body it is
 * named for, so its origin is that body's own position at the tick you ask &mdash; and that number
 * must have moved a long way between the two samples. One assertion says the identity held; the other
 * says there was something for it to hold against. The control is asserted FIRST, so a frozen universe
 * fails loudly rather than passing quietly.
 *
 * <h2>Why the clock is set rather than ticked</h2>
 * The orbital law is evaluated against the SPACE clock &mdash; the subsystem's own counter &mdash; and
 * twenty million real ticks is not an option, so {@code artest space set-clock} writes that counter
 * directly. It is put back afterwards: the counter is the subsystem's, not this test's, and this
 * server is shared with every other test in the fork, so an aged clock is exactly the kind of leaked
 * state that produces a failure three classes later. What the restore no longer has to undo is
 * collateral: the probe used to age the overworld's total world time, which moved every vanilla and
 * third-party gate keyed on it for whoever ran next.
 *
 * <p>Nothing else is synthetic: the bodies are the shipped world's own authored system, the query is
 * the production registry's, and the frame reading comes from the production {@code CellFrames}
 * lookup. No Valkyrien Skies and no ship &mdash; the subject is what the registry answers about a
 * cell, which is upstream of everything a ship does with it.</p>
