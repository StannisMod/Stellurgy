/**
 * Server e2e for tier-2 space persistence across a REAL server restart: two separate server JVMs
 * over one and the same world directory.
 *
 * <p>Every other test of this subsystem drives a probe-local stack and simulates a restart in
 * process, which cannot see the failures that only a genuine reboot produces — a snapshot that is
 * marked dirty too late to be written, an id that was minted per session and silently changed, a
 * restore hook that never runs because the production wiring stood down. This test closes that gap
 * by using the production path end to end: the shipped server-start hook builds the subsystem, the
 * shipped world-save hook writes it, the process really exits, and the shipped server-started hook
 * on the SECOND boot is what has to bring the state back from disk.</p>
 *
 * <p>The subsystem normally stands down when it detects a test harness (the probes register their
 * own dimension pool, and two pools would fight over slot ids), so the world is pre-seeded with the
 * config flag that opts back in. That flag is the whole reason this test can exist.</p>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here touches physics — what is under test is the persistence of the server's record of
 * where ships are, not a loaded ship. It is nonetheless a test, because the
 * subsystem declines to register at all without Valkyrien Skies (no tier-2 ships to host means
 * nothing worth registering ten dimensions for), so the wiring under test would not exist.</p>
