/**
 * Repro (finding C066) for the warp-arrival
 * ConcurrentModificationException.
 *
 * <p>{@code SpaceObjectManager.onServerTick} iterated {@code
 * spaceStationOrbitMap.get(WARPDIMID)} with a live for-each while {@code
 * moveStationToBody} removed the arriving station from that same list. With three or
 * more stations completing their warp transition on the same tick this threw a {@code
 * ConcurrentModificationException}, aborting the transition tick (with exactly two the
 * LinkedList quietly drops the second instead of throwing — a sibling symptom of the
 * same iterate-while-mutate defect). The fix iterates a snapshot copy.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@code station warp-collision} probe puts three stations into the warp orbit
 * (WARPDIMID) with an already-elapsed transition and invokes {@code onServerTick(null)}
 * directly, catching. This pins the corrected contract: no throw, and ALL stations
 * arrive at their destination orbit. Server-tier (a server-thread crash); no client
 * surface. Fresh server per method — warp/orbit state is a global mutation.</p>
