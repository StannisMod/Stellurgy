/**
 * SPIKE — does anything actually break past ±2M blocks, the bound the space cell was sized for?
 *
 * <p>`space-model.md` says a 4M cell exists because "entity doubles / chunks / lighting degrade past
 * ~±2M blocks in 1.12.2". Three mechanisms in one sentence, and the cell size — hence how big a planet
 * may be drawn — rests on all three. This measures the two a server can see: <b>chunk generation</b>
 * and <b>block storage</b>. The third (render jitter) is client-side and is measured separately.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>This spike is designed to come back NO.</b> The acceptance number is stated here, before the
 * run: at each sampled X, terrain must generate (a non-air top block at a plausible height) and a
 * placed block must read back as itself. A coordinate where either fails is a real ceiling; a
 * coordinate where both hold tells us the ceiling is not here.</p>
 *
 * <p>Throwaway by intent: it exists to answer one question once. If it is kept, it becomes a
 * regression test for "the world still works at the coordinates our cells use", which is a different
 * claim from the one it was written for.</p>
