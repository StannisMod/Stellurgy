/**
 * Regression guard (finding C076) for the grid-mapping fix in
 * {@code SpaceObjectManager.getSpaceStationFromBlockCoords}.
 *
 * <p>Stations spawn at {@code 2*stationSize*gridX + stationSize/2} — a half-cell
 * offset from the grid point. The reverse lookup formerly reverse-mapped with a bare
 * {@code round(worldX/(2*stationSize))}, which did NOT subtract that offset, so a
 * solar tile built in the block-placement-reach sliver a few blocks past the +X/+Z
 * confinement wall (a position a real player reaches at the station perimeter)
 * mis-mapped to the empty neighbouring grid cell → {@code
 * getSpaceStationFromBlockCoords} returned null → 0 RF on a panel physically sitting
 * on a real, powered station. The fix subtracts the {@code stationSize/2} spawn
 * offset before rounding, so the whole habitable footprint (plus the reach sliver)
 * maps back to the owning cell.</p>
 *
 * <p>This pins the corrected contract: a control panel at the station spawn center
 * generates &gt; 0, and an identical panel on the +X perimeter sliver of the SAME
 * station also generates &gt; 0. The only difference between the two placements is
 * worldX (grid cell), isolating the reverse-mapping offset as the variable under
 * test. If the offset correction regresses, the sliver drops back to 0 and this
 * fails.</p>
 *
 * <p>Fresh server per method (station registration is a global mutation);
 * getInsolationMultiplier's own null-planet guard is exercised separately by
 * {@code test/unit/SpaceStationInsolationUnresolvedPlanetTest}.</p>
