/**
 * A pilot seat's mount faces where its SHIP faces.
 *
 * <p>The dummy a pilot rides is bound to a seat block that lives in the ship's subspace while the
 * ship itself flies around the world, and it is snapped onto the seat's live world position every
 * tick. Its POSITION therefore tracks the ship — but position is only half of a mount. Anything that
 * asks the thing the player is riding <em>which way am I pointing</em> reads its ROTATION, and a
 * rotation nobody writes is a constant: it answers "due south" on every ship, on every heading, for
 * ever. That is not a rendering nicety — it is a mount that lies about the ship it is glued to.
 *
 * <p><b>The arrangement has to be able to fail.</b> A freshly assembled ship sits on the axis, where
 * a stuck-at-zero rotation and the true heading are the same number. So the ship is TURNED first and
 * the turn is read back off the ship itself; the assertion only means something after that gate, and
 * the gate is a hard failure rather than a skip.
 *
 * <p>Gated on the server's real VS presence; skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
