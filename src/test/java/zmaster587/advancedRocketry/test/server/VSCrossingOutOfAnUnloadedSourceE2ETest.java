/**
 * The other way a crossing can leave a ship behind: the REGISTRY entry of a source that was not loaded
 * when its blocks were cut.
 *
 * <p>{@link VSCrossingLeavesNoShipBehindE2ETest} covers the case where the source ship is loaded — there,
 * a physics object is what can be stranded. This one covers the opposite starting state, where no physics
 * object exists at all, so whatever collects a crossing's leftovers has to work without one. An entry left
 * behind here has no blocks and nothing loaded behind it, yet it still answers position lookups in that
 * world — including the opening lookup of the next crossing out of the same place — and it is persisted
 * with the world, so it outlives a restart.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Its own class, and its own server.</b> The arrangement it needs — a registered ship that is NOT
 * loaded — is exactly the state that makes the shared-harness load pump crash the server, so this leg is
 * kept away from any method that holds {@code permaload}. {@code permaload} is never set true here.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The counts are taken before anything asks the world to load a ship</b>, because loading a
 * leftover entry is itself what would collect it: measuring afterwards would measure the measurement.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on the server's real VS presence; skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
