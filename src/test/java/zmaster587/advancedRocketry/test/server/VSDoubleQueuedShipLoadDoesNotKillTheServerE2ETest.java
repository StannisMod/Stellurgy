/**
 * Asking for a ship that is already being loaded must load it once, never take the server down.
 *
 * <p>Two independent things can want the same unloaded ship loaded on the same tick: the world's own
 * loading pass, which queues a permanently-loaded ship for a BACKGROUND load while no player is near it,
 * and any explicit request for an immediate load. The immediate load runs first and completes; the
 * background pass then finds the ship already loaded. That is a satisfied request, not an error, but it
 * is raised as an exception from the world tick, with nothing between it and the server loop, so the
 * whole dedicated server dies.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is deterministic rather than a race.</b> The loading pass runs immediately before the
 * load queues are drained, every tick, so the background entry is minted on the very tick the immediate
 * load is served. The ordering inside that tick is fixed; there is no window to miss.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The arrangement is the whole difficulty.</b> The ship has to be REGISTERED and NOT LOADED at the
 * moment the load is requested, which is why it is built first (a ship is created loaded), then left
 * alone until the world unloads it again, and only then is permanent loading switched on. A ship that
 * never unloaded would make both requests collapse into one and the test would measure nothing, so the
 * unloaded state is asserted, not assumed.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Its own server, per method.</b> While the defect is live this test does not fail an assertion:
 * it kills the server process. On a shared harness that would take every later method in the class with
 * it and read as several unrelated failures.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The survival assertion comes first, and the ship-is-loaded assertion is its control.</b> "The
 * server is still up" passes trivially on a build where the load request did nothing at all, so the
 * second assertion is what proves the request was actually served.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on the server's real VS presence; skips cleanly otherwise.</p>
