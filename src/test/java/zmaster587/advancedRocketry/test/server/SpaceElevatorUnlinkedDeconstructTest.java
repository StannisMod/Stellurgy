/**
 * C051 — teardown of a space elevator that was never tether-linked.
 *
 * <p><b>Contract</b>: breaking (deconstructing) a Space Elevator multiblock
 * that has no active tether link must be a safe no-op on the link teardown —
 * never a server crash. {@code dimBlockPos} is null for an elevator that was
 * never linked (constructor default) or was unlinked in-game; a previously
 * linked elevator keeps its link across reload (the inherited
 * {@code readFromNBT} restores {@code dimBlockPos} via the virtual
 * {@code readNetworkData}), so the unlinked states above are exactly the ones
 * {@code deconstructMultiBlock} must tolerate.</p>
 *
 * <p>Drives {@code deconstructMultiBlock} via the {@code artest machine
 * deconstruct} probe on a fixture-built (never try-completed, never linked)
 * elevator controller. That is the same method the production block-break
 * teardown invokes on a formed multiblock
 * ({@code BlockMultiblockMachine.breakBlock} is completion-gated, so the
 * in-world crash needs a completed unlinked elevator; the probe drives the
 * method directly on the fixture state, where the NPE site is identical).
 * Driving the method directly (rather than breaking the block in-world) also
 * isolates THIS teardown path from the unrelated hidden-multiblock
 * deconstruct NPE documented in {@link SpaceElevatorMultiblockTest}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Repro history: pre-fix this test pinned the wrong behaviour (teardown
 * threw {@code NullPointerException} from
 * {@code TileSpaceElevator.deconstructMultiBlock}); flipped to the corrected
 * contract with the C051 null-guard (Path B - the caller drops it).</p>
 *
 * <p>Position-isolated at x=6580: SpaceElevatorMultiblockTest's fixtures span
 * roughly x 6496..6564 (controllers at 6500/6530/6560 ± the footprint), this
 * footprint starts at ~6576 — no overlap, and each test class gets a fresh
 * temp world anyway.</p>
