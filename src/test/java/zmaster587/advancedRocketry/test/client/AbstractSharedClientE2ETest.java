/**
 * Class-scoped client-harness base: ONE server JVM and ONE client JVM for every {@code @Test} in
 * the subclass, instead of one pair per method.
 *
 * <h2>Why</h2>
 *
 * <p>Measured on the maintainer's box, 2026-08-06, from the result XML:
 * {@code ModCountParityE2ETest} — whose entire body is one {@code report_mods} call — takes
 * <b>119.2 s</b>, and {@code OreScannerRightClickClientE2ETest}'s two methods take 120.1 s and
 * 101.8 s and print <b>two distinct client pids</b>. A four-scenario run on ONE shared harness
 * costs <b>73.8 s of boot plus 2.1-3.7 s per scenario</b>. Boot is 25-35x the scenario, and better
 * than 95 % of this tier's wall clock. {@code build.gradle}'s {@code forkEvery 1L} then makes the
 * whole tier's floor equal to its LONGEST class, so the 27-method {@code FreeFlightModeE2ETest}
 * pins it at ~35 min in one fork while the other seven idle.</p>
 *
 * <h2>What a subclass owes</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>{@code @FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING)} on the concrete class.</b> JUnit's
 *       annotation is NOT {@code @Inherited} (checked: it carries only {@code @Retention} and
 *       {@code @Target}), so this base cannot supply it — and without it "the methods are
 *       independent" is a belief rather than a property. {@link #enforceDeterministicOrder} fails
 *       loudly rather than letting a subclass run in an undefined order.</li>
 *   <li><b>Stay inside {@link #plot()}.</b> Each scenario is handed its own 64-block patch, never
 *       recycled. A scenario that asks a GLOBAL question ({@code artest rocket list},
 *       {@code artest station list}) must narrow the answer with {@link Plot#contains}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Declare the phase</b> as it goes, through {@link #scenario()} — that is what lets a
 *       failure name the broken system without anyone opening this file.</li>
 *   <li><b>No un-restored global mutation.</b> Atmosphere density, weather, permaload and a server
 *       restart are not shareable; a scenario needing one belongs on the per-method
 *       {@link AbstractClientE2ETest} instead.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>The reset, and why it is asserted rather than trusted</h2>
 *
 * <p>A shared client carries state across scenarios. Measured on the second scenario of a shared
 * run, ALL FOUR of these were still holding the first scenario's leavings: an open
 * {@code GuiModular}; an action-bar overlay at {@code overlayTicks=50}, still counting down; the
 * previous scenario's item in the hotbar; and the player standing on the previous plot.</p>
 *
 * <p>The chat backlog is the dangerous one, and it is why the pilot for this base class was chosen
 * to be a chat-asserting test: a scenario that proves "the player was told X" by searching the last
 * N chat lines passes on the PREVIOUS scenario's identical line, with no stimulus behind it at all.
 * {@code ItemSealDetectorPlayerMessagesE2ETest} has three methods expecting the same message.</p>
 *
 * <p>So {@link #resetBetweenScenarios} does the reset and then <b>asserts the world is clean</b>. A
 * reset nobody checks is indistinguishable from no reset.</p>

     * client that never received the teleport is a round-trip that was read too early, while one
     * that received it and ended up elsewhere has a SECOND WRITER owning the body. Measured
     * 2026-08-12 — four scenarios of {@code VSShipFlightTelemetryE2ETest} red in two of three
     * identical tier runs, each printing one coordinate pair outside every plot in the lane, with
     * {@code harnessAlive=true}; nothing in the message distinguished the two, and the mode stayed
     * unattributable for a session.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>It runs after the verdict is already decided, and that is deliberate.</b> The first cut
     * of this made the plot check itself poll — which changes how many ticks every GREEN scenario
     * spends before it starts, and the class this was written for went from 8/8 to 5 reds in the
     * tier and 7/8 alone. An instrument that moves the arrangement is not an instrument. Everything
     * here is a client-side read (no server command, so no chat marker) on a path that is already
     * failing, so a passing scenario pays exactly nothing.</p>
