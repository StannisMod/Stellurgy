/**
 * A player who SITS DOWN IN THE PILOT SEAT BEFORE HIS SHIP IS ASSEMBLED must still be flying that
 * ship the moment assembly finishes - without standing up and sitting down again.
 *
 * <p>This is how a human actually builds and boards a tier-2 craft: he walks onto the launchpad,
 * right-clicks the pilot seat while the craft is still a pile of loose blocks, and only then runs
 * the assembly. The seat he clicked is therefore the seat at its ORIGINAL world position. Assembly
 * moves the craft's blocks into the ship's own coordinate space, and the pilot's control binding has
 * to survive that move.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Two methods, because this scenario changes TWO things at once.</b> Measured against the
 * working post-assembly-boarding flight test, the human's route differs in WHEN he boards (before vs
 * after assembly) AND in HOW he boards (a real client right-click on the seat block vs a probe that
 * spawns the seat dummy server-side and mounts it). A single red run over both variables could not
 * say which one drove it. So the scenario is run twice over a {boarding mechanism} x {boarding
 * moment} matrix:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *                     | pre-assembly            | post-assembly
 *   ------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------------
 *   probe mount       | {@link #aPilotBoardedByProbeBeforeAssemblyCanFlyTheShip()}
 *                     |                         | (the existing passing flight test)
 *   real right-click  | {@link #aPilotWhoRightClickedTheSeatBeforeAssemblyCanFlyTheShip()}
 *                     |                         | NOT REACHABLE
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The fourth cell - a real right-click on the seat of an ALREADY ASSEMBLED ship - cannot be
 * written with this harness, and that hole is named rather than hidden: the client's block
 * interaction takes WORLD coordinates, while an assembled ship's blocks live in the ship's own
 * subspace at coordinates the client never renders at. There is no world position to click.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What the two methods jointly discriminate.</b> If BOTH fail, the driver is WHEN: the pilot's
 * control binding does not survive assembly, regardless of how it was established. If ONLY the
 * right-click method fails, the driver is HOW: the real block-activation path never confers ship
 * control in the first place, and the pre-assembly moment is innocent.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The boarding must be confirmed, not assumed.</b> A seat's block-activation handler reports
 * success to the client unconditionally while doing its real work server-side only, so the client's
 * own return value cannot distinguish "the player sat down" from "the server silently dropped the
 * right-click" (reach limit, an unconfirmed teleport, a held item preempting the click). The test
 * therefore confirms the boarding independently, from what the CLIENT reports it is riding - and
 * checks WHAT it is riding and WHERE that thing is, so "he took the pilot seat" cannot be satisfied
 * by riding something else. A failure there is reported as a BROKEN ARRANGEMENT, not as a broken
 * contract.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The climb is measured against a no-key control leg.</b> A freshly assembled physics object
 * that overlaps solid geometry can be resolved by displacing it UPWARD, and this craft is assembled
 * directly above a solid launchpad. Without a control, that settle would be credited to the pilot's
 * key and turn a still-broken control path green - the worst possible outcome, because a green here
 * would be read as "the bug is not real". So the ship is first settled to a stable altitude, then
 * its free drift is measured over a window of the SAME length as the measurement window with NO key
 * held, and only then is the key-held climb measured. Both numbers are reported side by side.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>History.</b> This file began as the missing repro for a craft that a hand-boarded pilot
 * could not fly: a pilot seated before assembly kept riding a mount bound to the seat's build-time
 * world position, which assembly vacates, so nothing in his control chain resolved and the piloting
 * client never sent a single input packet. It now pins the fixed contract: the assembler queues
 * every seated pilot's binding for re-expression onto the relocated seat, and both cells must stay
 * green.</p>
 *
 * <p>Manual server + client lifecycle rather than the shared base class, because the config has to be
 * written into the game directory BEFORE the server boots and the base class owns a throwaway root
 * it never exposes. Each method pays a full harness boot; that cost is accepted here because the
 * discrimination between the two variables is the entire point of the file.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on real Valkyrien Skies - run with {@code -PwithVS}.</p>
