/**
 * The full-path tier-2 flight e2e: a bot flies a real Valkyrien Skies ship with real keys, a real
 * mouse and a real camera, and every assertion reads something the CLIENT itself produced.
 *
 * <p>Each test pins one behaviour a hands-on playtest found broken, so each would have failed before
 * the fix that carries it:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The flight panel shows the ship's real speed.</b> The HUD is rendered from the client's own
 *       snapshot of the craft; a tier-1 rocket has always drawn a three-axis velocity + Flight-Assist
 *       setpoint panel, and a tier-2 ship drew nothing because neither number reached the client.</li>
 *   <li><b>Centring the flight cursor stops the ship turning.</b> A ship is a rigid body carrying
 *       angular momentum; unlike a rocket it does not stop just because the pilot stopped asking it to
 *       turn. Its controller must actively brake the residual spin.</li>
 *   <li><b>The camera turns over with the ship, and the eye stays out of the deck.</b> Vanilla adds the
 *       eye height along the WORLD up, so on an inverted ship the pilot's eye ends up inside the deck
 *       hanging above his seat and he sees nothing at all.</li>
 *   <li><b>A crew member stays on a steeply rolled deck.</b> Vanilla's vertical drag (0.98) and its
 *       horizontal friction (0.91) are not the same number, so a deck-down pull with world X/Z
 *       components is bent steeply toward world +Y: the crew member is flung up a wall.</li>
 * </ul>
