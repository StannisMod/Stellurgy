/**
 * Hyperspace transit with a crew member aboard: four scenarios that used to be four classes and four
 * client boots, now one boot.
 *
 * <h2>Why this cluster shares safely</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every scenario here arranges itself through {@code artest space transit-setup-piloted} /
 * {@code -empty}, and that probe allocates a <b>fresh origin pool cell per call</b>. So each
 * scenario works in a dimension of its own: the whole-dimension ship counts these bodies use as
 * assembly gates ({@code vs ship-count-all &lt;originDim&gt;}) are scoped by construction, not by
 * luck, and none of them needed narrowing. That is the opposite of the ground-fixture cluster, where
 * every scenario shares dim 0 and the gates had to be rewritten.</p>
 *
 * <p>The three things the scenarios DO leave behind are closed by
 * {@link AbstractSharedVsClientE2ETest}: a still-riding player, {@code vs permaload} (each scenario
 * switches it on for itself), and the flight computer's static command channels. Their original
 * {@code @After cleanup()} methods did the first two by hand and did not check them; the shared
 * reset asserts both, so those methods are dropped rather than carried over.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code bot().setRenderDistance} is the one channel that belongs to this family alone — the
 * sky-observing scenario widens it — so it is restored here, in the reset, and not in an
 * {@code @After} (which JUnit runs BEFORE the failure watcher, destroying the journal a red needs).
 * It is static because JUnit builds a fresh test instance per method while the client JVM keeps the
 * setting.</p>
