/**
 * A player can board an ALREADY ASSEMBLED physics ship by aiming at its pilot seat and pressing the
 * real use key - the same two actions a human performs, through the same two code paths.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this test exists.</b> The harness was believed unable to reach an assembled ship's
 * blocks at all, so every crew test boards through a server-side probe that spawns the seat's mount
 * and mounts the bot onto it. That belief rests on the harness's {@code interactBlock}, which calls
 * {@code PlayerControllerMP.processRightClickBlock} DIRECTLY with a caller-supplied world position -
 * and an assembled ship's blocks do not live at any world position, they live in the ship's own
 * subspace. But that is a property of THAT shortcut, not of the client: vanilla never reaches
 * {@code processRightClickBlock} with a hand-picked position either. It polls the use KEY BINDING
 * every tick ({@code Minecraft.processKeyBinds}), and {@code rightClickMouse()} then feeds it
 * whatever the crosshair raytrace ({@code mc.objectMouseOver}) resolved - which on a physics ship is
 * the ship's own block, found by the physics mod's own hook on the raytrace. So the position problem
 * never arises: nobody supplies a position, the game finds one.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The claim under test</b> is therefore narrow and mechanical: aiming with {@code setLook} and
 * pressing the use key ({@code -99}, the code the mouse handler itself writes for RMB and the default
 * binding of {@code keyBindUseItem}) boards the pilot seat of an assembled ship. Nothing about the
 * assembly, the flight computer or the flight itself is under test here - the arrangement uses
 * probes freely, and only the aim-and-press hop is measured.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Every hop is observed, so a red names one.</b> An aim that missed and a click the server
 * refused are otherwise indistinguishable, which is exactly how the original limit came to be
 * mis-attributed. So the test asserts (1) the crosshair is on a block, (2) that block is the PILOT
 * SEAT in the client's own world, (3) at the seat's SUBSPACE position - the physics mod's raytrace
 * returning a subspace position is the whole reason a world-position shortcut could never work - and
 * only then presses, and finally asserts (4) the CLIENT reports itself riding the seat's mount, with
 * the server's own view cross-checked.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The recipe, for any test that wants to board an assembled ship for real.</b> Empty the hand
 * and confirm it from the client; read the seat's live WORLD position and its SUBSPACE address from
 * the same probe reading; stand within a couple of blocks of the seat (see {@link #VARIANT} - aiming
 * from far away loses the hit to a distance comparison, not to any missing capability); aim with
 * {@code setLook} computed from the CLIENT's own eye position; confirm the crosshair with
 * {@code reportMouseOver} before pressing; then {@code setKey(-99, true)} / wait / release.</p>
 *
 * <p>Manual server + client lifecycle rather than the shared base class, matching the other
 * ship-boarding e2e tests. Gated on real Valkyrien Skies - run with {@code -PwithVS}.</p>
