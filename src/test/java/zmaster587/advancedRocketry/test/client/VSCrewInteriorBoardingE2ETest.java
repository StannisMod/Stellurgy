/**
 * Interior boarding of a non-upright ship - the enclosed-interior capture, and the flying-aboard
 * rule that lets a creative flyer be captured without ever touching the deck.
 *
 * <p>The pinned contract: a body inside a ship's hull with a deck below it IN THE SHIP FRAME is
 * the DECK's to claim - stopping creative flight there seats it back on the deck (ship-frame
 * gravity carries it, at any attitude) with the ship camera engaged. Before the interior gate
 * existed, WORLD gravity owned that body instead: over this fixture's cockpit opening (facing
 * world-down at 170 degrees) it fell clean out of the ship to the terrain; in an enclosed
 * cavity it was pinned to the interior world-floor by the outer-hull fallback with a world
 * camera - the reported "captured, but the camera never flips" desync. Both flavors of that
 * gap are closed by the same gate this test pins.</p>
