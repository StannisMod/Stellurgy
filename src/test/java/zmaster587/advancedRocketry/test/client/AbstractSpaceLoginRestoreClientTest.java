/**
 * Login restore for a tier-2 ship's crew, observed on the REAL CLIENT across a REAL server restart:
 * a player who logs out seated on his ship in a space cell has to come back aboard that ship, in his
 * ship's own slot dimension - not in the overworld, and not merely standing beside it.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this must be a client test.</b> The only real subject of this contract is a live player
 * with a client attached. The first restore phase rewrites where a logging-in player is placed, and
 * the second re-seats him a few ticks later; the unit tier fakes the whole world seam and the server
 * tier has no logging-in player at all, so both of those are blind here BY CONSTRUCTION. They are
 * already green. This test is therefore the primary verification, not a formality on top of one.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Shape.</b> Two server boots over one world root, two client JVMs, manual harness lifecycle.
 * The harness reserves a fresh port on every boot, so a client cannot be reconnected across a
 * restart; a second client JVM is started instead. That is sound because the client's identity is
 * deterministic - every client launches under the same username and therefore under the same
 * offline-mode UUID, and the server keys player data by UUID. Boot 1 arranges and witnesses, then
 * the server is simply stopped with NO explicit save first: the shutdown save is part of what is
 * under test, and saving twice would hide an implementation that only marks its snapshot dirty
 * during that last pass.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The ship gets into space the way a ship really gets into space.</b> The arrangement does not
 * conjure a settled ship: it builds a piloted tier-2 ship on the ground with the real assembler,
 * feeds it a held-throttle input so its flight computer sees a pilot flying, and lifts it past the
 * launch dimension's orbit ceiling. The flight computer's own server tick then runs the entry
 * on-ramp, which picks the destination cell, crosses the ship into it and settles it in the ship
 * ledger. Every identifier this test works with - the ship id, the cell, the slot dimension - is
 * therefore CHOSEN BY PRODUCTION and read back, never invented here. That matters beyond tidiness:
 * the restore reads the very ledger that entry wrote, so an arrangement that wrote its own ledger
 * would be testing a fixture instead of the subsystem.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What the instrument actually delivers.</b> Acceptance is client-observed: the client's own
 * rendered dimension, its own riding entity, its own position. The limit has to be stated honestly -
 * "he never appeared in the overworld" is SAMPLED, not proven. There is no client-side
 * dimension-change transcript, so this test observes where the client IS when it looks, never every
 * frame it passed through on the way. A restore that flickered through an overworld frame and then
 * corrected itself would still read green here; what is proven is the end state.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Exactly ONE ship in the cell.</b> The entry materializes a fresh cell for a single ship, and
 * that is load-bearing rather than incidental: the re-seating matches a seat by proximity to the
 * ship's pose and by the seat's flight-computer link offset, with no ship-id filter. Two ships of
 * the same fixture geometry parked near each other share that offset, so a second nearby ship could
 * satisfy the riding assertion for the wrong ship. One ship per cell removes the ambiguity by
 * construction instead of by hoping. The same assumption lets the ship be located by "the ship
 * nearest any point in the cell" without a search.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Scope.</b> Every branch of the restore decision is already pinned exhaustively at the unit
 * tier and is deliberately not re-derived here. What this adds is that the REAL wiring runs that
 * decision: a real ledger written by the real entry path, persisted to and restored from disk, the
 * real login hook, a real slot dimension registered again on the second boot, and a real client that
 * has to end up inside it - with a WORKING control chain: a seated return whose held key no longer
 * flies the ship is the play-reported shape of a broken relog, so both sides of the restart hold the
 * client's real vertical-up key and require the client-rendered altitude to climb (the pre-restart
 * leg makes a post-restart red attributable to the restore rather than to a chain that never worked
 * in the cell).</p>
 *
 * <p>Position is never written out as a literal. The pilot is expected back at his ship, so the
 * ship's own live pose is the actual he is compared against; and that pose is separately required to
 * realize a coordinate inside his ship's LEDGERED cell, checked through
 * {@link CellWorldMapper#coordOfPose(GalacticCoord, double, double, double)} - the documented
 * inverse of the cell-to-world pose mapping. That is what catches "right dimension, ordinary block
 * height": a position outside the pose band renormalises into a neighbouring sector and stops
 * matching the cell. Hardcoding the band offset instead would turn a legitimate retune of a value
 * documented as tunable into a test failure.</p>
 *
 * <p>Skips (never fails) when the server harness is off, when the client harness is off, or when
 * Valkyrien Skies is absent - the production subsystem declines to register without it, so the
 * wiring under test would not exist at all.</p>

     * while NOBODY is at the controls. A pilot INPUT cannot supply that: a riderless seat dummy
     * clears its computer's pilot input every tick, on purpose, and only a JVM-wide static was immune
     * - which is exactly why this family used one, and what it cost was that every other ship on the
     * server flew too. A retained cruise SETPOINT is what outlives a pilot planet-side, and it was
     * tried here first; measured twice on a settled ship in a CELL, at 4 and at 12 blocks/second, the
     * deck travelled 0.870 and 0.862 blocks in the same window. Tripling the command changed the
     * result by one percent, so the cruise is not being realized here at all and those numbers are
     * drift. That is a finding about ships in cells, recorded in the ledger, and it is not this
     * family's subject.
     *
     * <p>So the deck is driven through the computer's own PROBE command channel: per-tile, addressed
     * at this ship's computer, outranking the pilot channel and cleared by nothing. What it replaces
     * was no more production-shaped than it is - a server-wide static input - and the subject here is
     * a BODY on a moving deck, never how the deck came to move.</p>
