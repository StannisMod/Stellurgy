/**
 * SPIKE — can a player actually LIVE millions of blocks from the origin, or only exist there?
 *
 * <p>Chunk generation, block storage and entity doubles were already measured clean out to 28M with
 * the subject SPAWNED at the coordinate. None of them says anything about the thing that decides how
 * big a body may be drawn: whether a <b>player</b> walks, stands and collides normally out there.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why the first attempt could not reach 8M, and why the reason was not vanilla</h2>
 * A connected player could not be delivered past ~4M, and vanilla's speed check
 * ({@code NetHandlerPlayServer} "moved too quickly!") was blamed. It is not the cause. The physics
 * mod installs a cancellable {@code @Inject} at the HEAD of
 * {@code NetHandlerPlayServer.setPlayerLocation} that CANCELS any teleport whose destination it
 * considers its own reserved "shipyard" region, and that region is the half-open quadrant
 * {@code chunkX >= 318401 && chunkZ >= -1599} — i.e. every position with
 * <b>X ≥ 5,094,416 and Z ≥ -25,584</b>. Teleports into it are dropped silently: the command reports
 * success, the mixin cancels, and the player never moves. That is exactly the reported symptom, and
 * it is a mod-imposed wall five million blocks out, not a vanilla precision limit.
 *
 * <p>Two consequences drive this class. {@link #whereExactlyDoesADeliveryStopWorking()} pins the
 * boundary against numbers PREDICTED from that predicate, so the mechanism is proven rather than
 * inferred from "2M worked and 8M did not". And the playability ladder runs at
 * {@code Z = }{@value #ARENA_Z}, below the quadrant's Z edge, where the predicate is false at every
 * X — so the original question can be answered out to 28M without touching the physics mod.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Acceptance, stated before the run</h2>
 * Every rung is compared against the {@code x=0} rung measured in the same run, in the same arena,
 * with the same key held for the same number of ticks:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Walking distance</b> over {@value #WALK_TICKS} ticks of held {@code W} must be within
 *       <b>±10%</b> of the origin's, and at least {@value #MIN_WALK_BLOCKS} blocks absolute.</li>
 *   <li><b>Collision stand-off</b> from the wall walked into must be within
 *       <b>{@value #STANDOFF_TOLERANCE}</b> blocks of the origin's — the sharpest instrument here,
 *       being a sub-block quantity resolved from absolute coordinates.</li>
 *   <li><b>Standing</b>: {@code posY} within {@value #Y_TOLERANCE} of the floor top throughout.</li>
 *   <li><b>No rubber-band</b>: server and client agree on {@code posX} to within
 *       {@value #SYNC_TOLERANCE} blocks at rest.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Designed to come back NO.</b> If 28M behaves like the origin on all four, the ±2M bound has
 * nothing left holding it up. If it does not, the rung where it stops is the answer.</p>

     * horizontal symptom (sound positioning) does not touch walking, standing or collision.
     * 28M is the only rung that ever failed, and on both sides at once (client displacement 0.0000,
