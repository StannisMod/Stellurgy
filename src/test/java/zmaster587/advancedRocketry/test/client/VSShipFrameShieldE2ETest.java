/**
 * P3 (§4.3): the shield must ride an assembled Valkyrien Skies ship. A ship's blocks live in a
 * distant SUBSPACE shipyard while the hull flies around the world, so a naive world-frame shield would
 * project its shell at the shipyard, thousands of blocks from where the ship is. The {@code FieldFrame}
 * seam maps each emitter's subspace centre out through the ship transform, so the shell tracks the
 * flying hull, and exposes the hull's own velocity so impacts are taken relative to it (a cruising ship
 * must not bill its own crew).
 *
 * <p>This is a CLIENT e2e because a VS ship only loads with an observer present (the headless server
 * cannot load one — {@code VSShipMotionServerTest} documents that limit). With the client near the ship
 * the hull loads on both sides, so the shield's frame is verified through precise server probes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Ship-framed.</b> The emitter's field is ship-framed and its world centre sits at the loaded
 *       ship's world position — far from its subspace block pos.</li>
 *   <li><b>Tracks the hull.</b> Pushing the ship moves the shell's world centre with it, and the shell's
 *       reported surface velocity becomes non-zero — the relative-velocity input the deflection uses.</li>
 *   <li><b>Deflects on board.</b> A charged shield on the ship deflects an inbound arrow off its shell
 *       (the same absorption math, now around the ship-transformed centre).</li>
 * </ul>
 * The frame-blind deflection math itself is pinned standalone by {@code ShieldImpactAbsorptionTest}; here
 * we verify the two frame-dependent quantities (moving world centre + live surface velocity) on a real
 * loaded ship, plus one on-hull deflection. Gated on real VS — run with {@code -PwithVS}.</p>
