/**
 * A craft that never became a ship takes NO orders from the player sitting in it: not steering, not
 * a Flight-Assist / auto-takeoff / jump command, and not the cockpit camera. The CLIENT half of the
 * rule that an unassembled craft does not accept pilot input.
 *
 * <p>The pilot seat's flight-computer link is a BUILD-TIME INTENTION: the assembler records it
 * before the physics mod has confirmed the spawn, and a rejected spawn (over-size flood, bedrock
 * contact) leaves it set forever. Every client gate that asked the link ALONE therefore asserted a
 * flight state that did not exist — the steering keys were scoped into the cockpit, the per-tick
 * input was shipped to the server, and each edge-triggered command key (Flight Assist, auto-takeoff,
 * jump) reached the ship's computer and was answered by its gate instead of being refused as "not a
 * ship". A player watched a craft that does nothing, forever, tell him it was flying.</p>
 *
 * <p>The test is deliberately built around its own CONTROL, because both of its instruments can
 * fail silent:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Leg 1 (control, a REAL ship)</b> — the same key presses and the same counters on an
 *       assembled ship MUST move. This proves the harness's injected key actually reaches an
 *       edge-triggered handler, and that the new gate answers TRUE on a real ship, i.e. that leg 2's
 *       zeroes are the production gate refusing and not the test failing to press anything. Without
 *       it, a harness that swallowed the key would make leg 2 pass on a completely broken build.</li>
 *   <li><b>Leg 2 (subject, a linked craft that never assembled)</b> — arranged by the
 *       {@code artest vs seat-link} probe, which links a seat WITHOUT assembling (the only
 *       deterministic way to reproduce the post-failure state), and verified to be linked-but-not-a-
 *       ship before anything is pressed. The seat's own "not assembled" notice is read off the
 *       action bar first, so the overlay instrument is known to speak before silence is used as
 *       evidence.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p></p>
