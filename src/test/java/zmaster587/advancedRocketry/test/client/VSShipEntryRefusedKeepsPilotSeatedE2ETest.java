/**
 * A REFUSED space entry must cost the pilot nothing but a message: he stays IN HIS SEAT, in the
 * launch world, told why — never dismounted, never dropped, never silently ignored.
 *
 * <p>The refusal under test is real pool pressure: the space-cell pool is seeded to ONE slot and
 * that slot is held by a foreign cell before the flight, so when the pilot climbs his ship through
 * the orbit line the entry's own cell materialization is refused. The historical defect here was
 * an order-of-operations one — the crew was captured (dismounted, mounts retired) BEFORE the pool
 * was asked, so a refusal left the pilot standing (or falling) beside a ship that never went
 * anywhere. The contract is refusal-shaped: the crossing may unseat nobody until it is actually
 * granted.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What is asserted, all client-observed:</b> (1) the refusal message reaches the pilot's own
 * chat (i18n resolved — what the player reads); (2) he is STILL riding his seat mount after the
 * refusal (two consecutive positive samples); (3) his client is still in the launch dimension —
 * the ship never crossed; (4) nothing was ledgered into space. An in-run control leg first proves
 * plain flight works at all, and a second occupy proves the pool really is exhausted before the
 * climb starts.</p>

 * <p>Setup shortcuts, named: the bot boards via the {@code vs seat-mount} probe + mount-entity
 * (the harness cannot right-click a post-assembly ship-subspace block); pool pressure comes from a
 * probe-held cell occupant, not ten real ships. Neither changes the refusal path under test —
 * the flight computer's own tick fires the entry against the production subsystem.</p>
 *
 * <p>Manual server + client lifecycle: the config (pool size, orbit line) must be written into the
 * game directory BEFORE the server boots. Gated on real Valkyrien Skies — run with
 * {@code -PwithVS}.</p>
