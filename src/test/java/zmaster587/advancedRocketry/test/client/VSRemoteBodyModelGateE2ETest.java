/**
 * Which bodies the client draws standing on a ship, and which it leaves upright.
 *
 * <p>The local player's model/eye gate on the movement truth (resolved ABOARD a deck), but a
 * REMOTE body has no capture state on this side at all - the client resolves only its own
 * player's movement. The gate for everyone else therefore used to be world-AABB CONTAINMENT,
 * which is true across the whole air volume around the hull: a body standing on the ground beside
 * an inverted ship was drawn lying on its side. The contract under test is the spatial one - a
 * body is drawn ship-aligned when the SHIP CARRIES IT, not when it happens to be inside the
 * ship's box.
 *
 * <p>The observable is client-side and cumulative ({@code ShipFrameCamera.remoteModel*}): over a
 * window, how many model-rotation decisions were taken for remote bodies and how many of those
 * pushed a rotation. A per-frame decision for an arbitrary body is a transient - a first/last-call
 * snapshot would land on an arbitrary moment and say nothing.
 *
 * <p>The two legs are each other's control, and the pairing is what makes either meaningful:
 * leg A (body on terrain) asserts NO remote body is rotated; leg B (body on the deck) asserts the
 * same instrument DOES report a rotation for a carried body. Each leg proves the instrument fired
 * for ITS OWN subject via {@link #assertInstrumentFired} (samples &gt; 0) BEFORE trusting the
 * rotation count, so a zero can never pass either leg vacuously - leg A would otherwise pass just as
 * well if the gate rejected everything, or if the body were never rendered.
 *
 * <p>An earlier "leg 0" spawned a LONE cow on open ground as a separate control that the client
 * draws remote bodies at all. It was removed: each contract leg's {@code assertInstrumentFired}
 * already covers "the hook fired", and it covers the real gameplay case (a body near a ship) rather
 * than a no-ship scenario that never occurs in play. That lone-body leg was also the only flaky one
 * here - a lone subject on open ground was not reliably sampled when this class runs its methods in
 * one shared client after the ship-building legs (a teleport/render-settle race), while the
 * ship-anchored legs sample reliably.
 *
 *
 * <p><b>Known limitation, REVISIT WHEN VALKYRIEN SKIES SOURCE IS AVAILABLE.</b> Under the parallel
 * client gate (many client JVMs contending for one GPU) leg A's subject was intermittently never
 * DRAWN: measured, a red window rendered 543 frames yet ran {@code RenderLivingBase.applyRotations}
 * zero times for any living body, while the same client drew leg B's carried cow fine. So a world
 * entity standing inside a steeply-rolled ship's world AABB (leg A's precondition) is sometimes absent
 * from the vanilla living-render dispatch. The camera→subject offset is fixed, so it is not a frustum
 * miss; the suspected cause is Valkyrien Skies' per-frame handling of world entities that fall inside a
 * ship's world box - but VS is jar-only here, so the exact render path was not opened. Leg A works
 * around it by re-staging the subject until the client provably draws it (see {@link #MAX_STAGINGS});
 * that keeps the test honest without root-causing a symptom that needs GPU contention to appear and so
 * does not reach a single-client player. When VS is vendored as source, root-cause the render path and
 * decide whether the re-stage workaround can be retired.</p>
