/**
 * The two open tier-2 playtest bugs, pinned against a REAL CLIENT PLAYER on a REAL assembled ship -
 * the subject that can actually exhibit them. Both were reported from a hands-on playtest and neither
 * is reproducible by the earlier suite, which read an armour stand's position through a SERVER probe:
 * a server-only body cannot fall through a deck on the client, and a probe cannot see where the client
 * renders the player. This class drives and observes the client, so it can.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A walking client player on a GROUNDED ship's deck stays on it, not through it.</b> The
 *       maintainer stood on a docked ship and fell through the deck. The subject here is the bot
 *       itself - a walking client whose own client resolves its movement - and the observation is the
 *       Y its client renders, cross-checked against where the server holds it (the honest oracle).</li>
 *   <li><b>Standing up from the pilot seat while hovering keeps the ship up and the pilot aboard.</b>
 *       The maintainer hovered, stood up with Shift, and both fell: the ship dropped and he was left
 *       in the world. The ship's hold is driven by live pilot input, so it dies at dismount, and the
 *       dismounted player is handed to a capture path at the exact moment the deck starts falling.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h2>One client for all twelve scenarios</h2>
 *
 * <p>Measured 2026-08-07 over the whole ship client tier: these twelve scenarios cost <b>19.4
 * minutes across twelve client boots</b> — 97 s each, of which the body is a small minority. They
 * were the tier's wall-clock floor. Sharing one harness is what removes it, and the base coordinates
 * below are unchanged: the scenarios already stood 100 blocks apart, which is a plot allocator by
 * hand, and each one's ground is the ground its green runs were taken on.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two gates had to become scoped to survive a shared world, both marked at their call sites: the
 * pilot seat is now located INSIDE this scenario's own ship ({@code vs find-seat} at its base)
 * instead of taking the first pilot seat in the world, and "has the ship unloaded?" reads this
 * scenario's own base rather than a whole-dimension ship count that a neighbour's ship answers.</p>
