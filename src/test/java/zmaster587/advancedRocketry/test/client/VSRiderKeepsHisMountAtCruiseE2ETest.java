/**
 * A player riding a mount aboard a CRUISING ship never loses that mount.
 *
 * <p><b>The report.</b> Above roughly half throttle the client threw the maintainer out of his pilot
 * seat every few seconds and picked him up again, for the whole burn, while the server kept him
 * mounted and the ship flew on. The seat, not the ship, is what became unusable.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The mechanism.</b> A mount glued to a moving ship outruns the tracking anchor its own
 * {@code EntityTrackerEntry} publishes; once the rider is more than the mount's tracking range from
 * that stale anchor the server stops sending it, the client destroys it, and a passenger whose
 * vehicle was removed is dismounted on the next tick. This test measures BOTH ends in the same
 * samples: the server-side cause (is the rider still in the mount's tracking set, and how far has
 * the anchor fallen behind him) and the client-side consequence ({@code reportRidingEntity} plus the
 * client's own view of the mount entity).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the subject is a PASSENGER mount and not the pilot's seat.</b> Same mechanism, but only
 * this subject can be put under load on demand. A mount bound to a LINKED pilot seat republishes six
 * flight-telemetry floats, and every write re-pins its own anchor - vanilla's third refresh
 * disjunct - so its anchor never goes stale while anything about the flight is changing. Measured on
 * that subject: at 4.075 blocks/tick the lag never exceeded 3.34 blocks against a 16-block range, and
 * no speed the physics mod permits (it freezes a ship at ~223 blocks/s) can close that gap. The
 * pilot's own mount reaches the stale-anchor state the moment he stops working the controls and
 * coasts - which is exactly when the report's log shows the bursts - but a test cannot hold a real
 * ship that quiet on demand. A passenger's chair publishes nothing and is carried by the same deck.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The stimulus must be HORIZONTAL.</b> Vanilla's visibility test compares X and Z and ignores Y
 * entirely, so the obvious idiom in this suite - hold the throttle and climb - cannot exhibit this at
 * any speed. That is also why taking off from a planet at full throttle is symptom-free: it is
 * {@code fwd=0, vert=1}.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The instrument carries its own proof.</b> The bot is dismounted on purpose before the cruise
 * and the poll is required to SEE it; and the achieved speed and anchor lag are asserted, so a green
 * cannot mean "the arrangement never loaded the mechanism". Confirmed RED on the clean build at
 * 24/40 samples unseated with a 36.8-block anchor lag, GREEN with the fix at 0/40 and a 41.0-block
 * lag - i.e. the guard held under a HARDER load than the one that broke it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on real VS - run with {@code -PwithVS}.</p>
