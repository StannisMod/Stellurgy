/**
 * A scenario's own flight recorder, and the thing that makes its failure readable.
 *
 * <p>The problem this solves is not "the test went red", it is "the log cannot say WHICH SYSTEM is
 * broken". A client e2e has at least four ways to fail and they demand opposite responses — the
 * harness died, the arrangement never got built, the arrangement got built but never reached the
 * state the contract is about, or the contract itself is violated. Today all four arrive as one
 * {@code AssertionError} and a human has to open the source to tell them apart.</p>
 *
 * <p>So the PHASE is <b>declared</b> by the test as it runs, never guessed afterwards, and the
 * failure line carries it along with the subsystem the scenario claims to be about. A reader who has
 * never seen the file learns from one line whether to look at production, at the fixture, or at the
 * box the run happened on.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * E2E verdict=CONTRACT subsystem=seal-detector scenario=stoneFixture... step="read the player's chat"
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Two rules the phases encode:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Phase#ARRANGEMENT} failures must not read as product bugs. A fixture that did not
 *       build means the contract <em>was never tested</em> — the correct response is to fix the
 *       scaffolding and re-run, not to argue with production.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Phase#PRECONDITION} exists because a threshold test that never reached its threshold
 *       is indistinguishable, from the verdict alone, from one whose guard held. Record the
 *       mechanism's measured INPUT under this phase before the verdict, and the two separate.</li>
 * </ul>

     *       nothing it reports is about the product. Outranks everything, including its own
     *       declared phase.</li>
     *   <li><b>The harness is not answering</b> — a failure raised while the client is dying is not
     *       a contract violation, however confidently the scenario had declared CONTRACT.</li>
     *   <li><b>An {@link ArrangementFailure}</b> — a helper threw it, which beats whatever phase the
     *       scenario had most recently declared.</li>
     *   <li><b>No scenario at all</b> — the failure happened before or inside the shared setup.</li>
     *   <li>Otherwise the scenario's own <b>declared</b> phase. Declared, never guessed.</li>
