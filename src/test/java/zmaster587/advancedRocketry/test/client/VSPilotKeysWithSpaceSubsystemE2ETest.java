/**
 * A seated pilot must be able to fly his ship WHILE THE SPACE SUBSYSTEM IS LIVE.
 *
 * <p>This is the same stimulus as the plain pilot-keys e2e - a real client player on the pilot seat
 * holding the real vertical-up key - with one difference: the production space subsystem is switched
 * ON. That difference is the whole point.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why this test has to exist separately.</b> The subsystem stands down whenever it detects a
 * test harness, so EVERY other tier-2 flight test on this branch runs with the branch's own headline
 * feature disabled. In real play it is the other way round: {@code enableSpaceSubsystem} defaults to
 * true and Valkyrien Skies is on by default for {@code runClient}/{@code runServer}, so a player is
 * always flying with the subsystem live. The flight computer's tick has subsystem-dependent branches
 * (a hyperspace park gate, a cell pose report, the entry on-ramp and the descent check), and NONE of
 * them are reachable in a harness run that leaves the subsystem down. The config flag seeded below
 * opts the production wiring back in, which is what makes this the configuration a player actually
 * runs.</p>
 *
 * <p>Manual server + client lifecycle rather than the shared base class, because the config has to be
 * written into the game directory BEFORE the server boots and the base class owns a throwaway root
 * it never exposes.</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on real Valkyrien Skies - run with {@code -PwithVS}.</p>
