/**
 * Login restore for a pilot who was ABOARD when he left: seated in a cell, seated on the ground
 * before the climb, or standing on his own deck. Each leg logs him out, restarts the server under
 * him, and requires him back on his ship.
 *
 * <p>See {@link AbstractSpaceLoginRestoreClientTest} for why this contract can only be tested on a
 * real client, and for the fixture the three legs share.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is three classes rather than one.</b> The original
 * {@code SpaceLoginRestoreClientE2ETest} held all seven legs, and every one of them boots a server
 * and a client and then restarts the server — 1032.8 s measured 2026-08-07 at 8 forks, in ONE gradle
 * fork, which made this single class the wall-clock FLOOR of the whole non-VS client tier while
 * seven forks idled. Sharing a harness is not available here: the restart IS the subject. So the
 * legs were split across three classes instead, which is the same optimisation from the other end —
 * the tier's floor is its longest UNIT, and a unit nobody can shorten can still be divided.</p>

     *
     * <p><b>Why this is a separate leg and not a variant of the arrangement above.</b> The durable

     * TRANSITION - so it existed for a pilot who sat down in a cell and did not exist for a pilot who
     * sat down on a planet and flew up. Both pilots are equally aboard, and the leg above cannot tell
     * them apart because its arrangement seats him after the arrival. This one is the route that was
     * broken in real play: fly to orbit, log out, come back standing at the build site you left hours
     * ago, with no message and your ship still in orbit without you.</p>
     *
     * <p>The arrangement is the witness for the mechanism as well as the setup for the restart: it
     * requires the record to be ABSENT while he sits on the planet and PRESENT once he has arrived,
     * so a green here cannot come from a record that was already there before the flight.</p>

     *
     * <p>Two contracts meet here and must not be confused. That he comes back NOT SEATED is one: a
     * player who left his post must not be dragged back into it by the next login. That he comes
     * back IN HIS SHIP'S CELL is the other, and it is the one this leg used to pin INVERTED -
     * standing up dropped the durable record entirely, the restore then had no evidence he had ever
     * been aboard, and he woke at his overworld build site with his ship still in orbit without him.
     * This leg is what says that is fixed.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>What replaced this leg's second job.</b> While it asserted "overworld" it also served as

     * {@link #aPlayerWhoWasNeverAboardIsNotRestoredOntoTheShip}.</p>
