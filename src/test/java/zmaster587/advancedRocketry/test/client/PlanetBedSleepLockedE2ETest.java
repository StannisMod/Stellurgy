/**
 * The shipped default, on a real client: <b>a bed on a planet sets your spawn and wakes you up, and
 * the morning does not come.</b>
 *
 * <p>A planet's day is the turning of a body in an orbit. Fast-forwarding it from a mattress is a
 * Minecraft convenience, not a planetary one, so past the atmosphere it is off — and the player is
 * TOLD, because silence is what makes a locked bed read as a broken bed.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why the chat line is the load-bearing assertion, not decoration</h2>
 * "The clock did not jump" is satisfied by a player who never fell asleep at all — a failed
 * right-click, a mob in range, a bed the server refused. The message is emitted from INSIDE the
 * sleep-completion branch, so its arrival proves the sleep completed AND that the lock is what
 * stopped the skip. It is asserted before the clock is, for that reason.
 *
 * <h2>Why the night is staged through the flag</h2>
 * Staging needs {@code /time set} to reach the planet, which is the very thing under test. So the
 * flag is turned on for the staging and off again before the player sleeps — the same runtime flip
 * the server-tier {@code /time} test uses. That the staging LANDED is asserted; without it the test
 * would sleep in the daytime and prove nothing.
 *
 * <p>The other side of this flag — with the arcade mechanic opted back in, the skip still landing on
 * the PLANET's own dawn rather than vanilla's 24000 rounding — is {@link PlanetBedSleepE2ETest}.
 * Neither class is a witness on its own: a build that ignored the flag entirely would satisfy
 * whichever of the two happened to match its hard-coded behaviour.</p>
