/**
 * A pilot who logs out SEATED logs back in SEATED — with a WORKING control chain: after the relog,
 * holding the real vertical-up key must lift the ship again, with no re-board and no re-click.
 *
 * <p>Subject: a planet-side assembled tier-2 ship. Here the relog path is vanilla's own mount
 * persistence — the seat mount rides the player's save data (removed from the world at logout,
 * re-spawned and re-mounted at login) and carries its seat binding in its entity NBT — so the pin
 * covers the full chain: the restored mount must still resolve its seat in the seat's CURRENT
 * frame, the client's input gate must re-open against the restored mount, and the input must reach
 * the ship's flight computer. A green "still riding" with a dead key would be exactly the
 * play-reported shape of a broken chain, which is why the post-relog CLIMB is the load-bearing
 * assertion, not the seating.</p>
 *
 * <p>The relog is real ({@code ClientBot.reconnect} — a full server logout with player-data save
 * and a fresh login). The boarding is the {@code vs seat-mount} probe + mount-entity (the harness
 * cannot right-click a post-assembly ship-subspace block); the flight stimulus and every
 * observation are the real client's (held key in; client-rendered rider altitude out).</p>
 *
 * <p>Gated on real VS — run with {@code -PwithVS}.</p>
