/**
 * A private patch of world handed to exactly one scenario of a shared-harness class.
 *
 * <p>When one client harness carries several scenarios they also share one WORLD, and that
 * multiplies a specific failure: a "find the X" query answering with a DIFFERENT scenario's object,
 * so the assertion passes on scaffolding the test never built. Three queries in the client suite are
 * already global and would do exactly this — {@code artest rocket list 0} in
 * {@code RocketBuilderGuiE2ETest} and {@code FreeFlightModeE2ETest}, {@code artest station list} in
 * {@code SpaceDimGuardE2ETest}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The defence is spatial and it is deliberately dumb: <b>one plot per scenario, never
 * recycled</b>. Nothing has to be cleaned up afterwards, because nothing else is ever going to look
 * here — which is cheaper and far more reliable than a teardown that has to be remembered. A
 * scenario that must ask a global question narrows it with {@link #contains} instead of trusting the
 * answer.</p>
 *
 * <p>Plots only need to be unique WITHIN a class: every test class boots its own harness and
 * therefore its own world.</p>

     * across its whole footprint, and the pinned seed grants that almost nowhere. Surveyed
     * 2026-08-14 with {@code artest worldgen survey} over each candidate's real 16x16 footprint:
     * <b>61 chunk-centre candidates across a 384x384 region, plus a 110-plot grid over the
     * neighbourhood, yielded exactly TWO clean plots</b> — this one and {@link #CLEAN_GROUND_Z2}.

     * solidObstructedColumns=0}, all grass, plains.</p>

     * <p>What the same survey said about where these fixtures USED to stand is why this exists:
     * 7200/7220 sit under a mountain whose surface is y=80..99, so a fixture at y=64 was buried
     * sixteen to thirty-five blocks inside rock; 7420 had 49 water columns; 3000 sat under a forest
     * canopy on ground at y=71..79. None were marginal landscapes a luckier seed would have saved.</p>
     *
     * <p>A flat harness world would make every coordinate equally good and was tried on 2026-08-14;
     * it cost more heap, more wall clock and three unexplained reds, so the survey stands.
     * <b>Do not move these numbers without re-running the survey</b> —
     * {@code FixtureGroundOnPinnedSeedTest} asserts every ground fixture's own surface.</p>
