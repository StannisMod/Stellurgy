/**
 * A private patch of world handed to exactly one scenario of a shared-harness class.
 *
 * <p>When one client harness carries several scenarios they also share one WORLD, and that
 * multiplies a specific failure: a "find the X" query answering with a DIFFERENT scenario's object,
 * so the assertion passes on scaffolding the test never built. Three queries in the client suite are
 * already global and would do exactly this — {@code artest rocket list 0} in
 * {@code RocketBuilderGuiE2ETest} and {@code FreeFlightModeE2ETest}, {@code artest station list} in
 * {@code SpaceDimGuardE2ETest}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The defence is spatial and it is deliberately dumb: <b>one plot per scenario, never
 * recycled</b>. Nothing has to be cleaned up afterwards, because nothing else is ever going to look
 * here — which is cheaper and far more reliable than a teardown that has to be remembered. A
 * scenario that must ask a global question narrows it with {@link #contains} instead of trusting the
 * answer.</p>
 *
 * <p>Plots only need to be unique WITHIN a class: every test class boots its own harness and
 * therefore its own world.</p>
