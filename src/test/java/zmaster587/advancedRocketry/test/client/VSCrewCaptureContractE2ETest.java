/**
 * The capture/release contract of the ship-frame crew - what makes a body ABOARD, what keeps it
 * there, and what leaves a bystander alone - pinned against a REAL CLIENT PLAYER — the subject that
 * broke in the inverted-boarding playtest. Two boundary behaviours that the world-AABB containment
 * gate got wrong:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Jumping on the TOP deck keeps the capture.</b> The hull's top surface sits at the
 *       ship's world-AABB ceiling; a jump apex from there crossed the old grown-box gate
 *       (`leftShipBox`) and the capture died MID-AIR — vanilla, blind to the subspace deck, then
 *       tunnelled the body through the whole ship. The stay region is measured in SUBSPACE with a
 *       real margin, so a jump must ride out and land back on the deck, still captured.</li>
 *   <li><b>A player walking on world TERRAIN near a ship is never captured.</b> A ground
 *       position mapped through a parked ship's transform can alias onto a subspace block, and the
 *       old first-contact gate then captured a walker who stood on plain ground beside the hull
 *       (the playtest's "entered the ship transform at a random place"). Terra firma always keeps
 *       world-frame movement.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h2>One client for all eleven scenarios</h2>
 *
 * <p>Measured 2026-08-07: these eleven cost <b>19.3 minutes across eleven client boots</b> — 105 s
 * each, nearly all of it startup — and with {@code VSDeckCaptureAndDismountE2ETest} they were the
 * ship tier's wall-clock floor. The bases below (5220…6420, 100 blocks apart) are unchanged: they
 * are a plot allocator written by hand, and each is the ground its green runs were taken on.</p>
