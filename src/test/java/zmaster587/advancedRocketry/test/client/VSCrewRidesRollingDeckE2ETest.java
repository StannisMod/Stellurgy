/**
 * A crew member who is NOT seated rides a tier-2 ship's deck.
 *
 * <p>The contract, stated as the player sees it: <b>stand on a tier-2 ship, roll the ship, and you
 * are still standing on it.</b> You travel with the deck rather than being left behind in the world
 * or dropped through the hull. This is the foundation every walking-crew feature is built on, so it
 * is pinned before any of them exist.</p>
 *
 * <p>Both halves are asserted against a REAL client standing on a REAL assembled ship:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the standing player is aboard <em>this</em> ship - his world position lies inside the ship's
 *       box (he is not merely near it) - and he is not "mounted": this is walking crew, not a seated
 *       pilot;</li>
 *   <li>after the ship is commanded to a ~45 degree roll he is <b>still aboard and still on the
 *       ground</b>, and his position <em>relative to the ship</em> has moved far less than his
 *       position in the world - i.e. he rode the deck instead of standing still while it left.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>What this deliberately does NOT pin: his orientation, the direction gravity pulls him, or the
 * shape of his collision box. Those are the open problems of the walking-crew work; this test only
 * guarantees the ground he stands on.</p>
