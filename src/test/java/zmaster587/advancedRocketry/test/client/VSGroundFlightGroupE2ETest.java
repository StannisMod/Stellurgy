/**
 * Ground-assembled tier-2 ships, flown: four scenarios that used to be four classes and four client
 * boots, now one boot.
 *
 * <p>Each scenario keeps the base coordinates its own green runs were taken on — 2200, 2400, 2600,
 * 2800 along the x==z diagonal, 200 blocks apart — because a migrating test that changes its ground
 * has changed its subject. The fifth scenario is not a migration: it is the control that proves the
 * ship oracle this class relies on can tell two ships apart.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why every ship question here is keyed on an ID</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code vs ship-info <dim> <x> <y> <z>} answers about the loaded ship NEAREST the point. On the
 * one-boot-per-test world these scenarios came from there was only ever one ship, so the position
 * was an identity by accident. Here there are four, and neither available bound works: unbounded,
 * the reply describes whichever neighbour happens to be closest; bounded by
 * {@link #SHIP_QUERY_RADIUS}, it describes nothing at all as soon as a scenario flies its ship
 * further than that — and {@link #seatedPilotFliesShipTravelsWithItAndCameraLocksToNose} holds the
 * lift key for sixty uninterrupted ticks on purpose. So each scenario captures its ship's id the
 * moment it loads and asks by id from then on.</p>
