/**
 * SPIKE — does a CONNECTED player's sub-block position survive the client↔server round trip far from
 * the origin?
 *
 * <h2>What this is NOT, and the retraction it carries</h2>
 * This class was first written around the observation "a 0.05-block move lands at 2M and 4M and does
 * not land at all at 8M, 12M or 16M", and it went looking for the coordinate at which precision runs
 * out. That observation was an artefact of its own delivery. The physics mod cancels, silently, any
 * teleport whose destination falls in its reserved shipyard quadrant — {@code chunkX >= 318401 &&
 * chunkZ >= -1599}, i.e. <b>X ≥ 5,094,416 and Z ≥ -25,584</b> — and the old arena sat at {@code Z = 0},
 * so every rung from 8M up was refused by a mod constant rather than by any property of the number.
 * The command still reported success. Nothing about precision was ever measured.
 *
 * <p>So the arena moves to {@code Z = }{@value #ARENA_Z}, below the quadrant's Z edge, where the
 * predicate is false at every X, and the long jump between rungs is delivered by
 * {@code /artest player far-tp} (vanilla's own dimension-change path, which is how a long jump escapes
 * the speed check). The short sub-block steps stay on plain {@code /tp}: they are not long jumps and
 * they are outside the quadrant.</p>
 *
 * <h2>The question that is actually left</h2>
 * Two neighbouring facts already exist and neither answers it:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code SpikeFarCoordinateIntegrityTest} spawns armour stands 0.05 apart out to 28M and reads
 *       both back exactly — but a SPAWNED entity's position never crosses the wire.</li>
 *   <li>{@code SpikeFarCoordinatePlayabilityTest} measures a 0.3000 collision stand-off at 16M/20M/24M
 *       — a sub-block quantity, but one produced by the server's own physics, not asked for.</li>
 * </ul>
 * What remains is the round trip: a position ASKED for at a far coordinate, written by the server,
 * pushed to the client, and read back from both. If anything in that path narrows to a float, a
 * quantum of 1 or 2 blocks at 16M is what it would look like — and it would show here and nowhere else.
 *
 * <h2>Acceptance, stated before the run</h2>
 * At every rung, for every offset in the ladder {0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0} from the same base:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>the SERVER's {@code posX} must equal the asked position within
 *       {@value #SERVER_TOLERANCE} blocks;</li>
 *   <li>the CLIENT's own {@code posX} must agree with it within {@value #CLIENT_TOLERANCE} blocks;</li>
 *   <li>every non-zero offset must read back DISTINCT from the offset-0 base — a quantum would
 *       collapse the small ones onto it.</li>
 * </ol>
 * {@code x = 0} is carried as the control in the same run, same arena shape, same commands: if the
 * control fails, the instrument is broken and no rung is evidence of anything.
 *
 * <p><b>Designed to come back NO.</b> If every offset resolves at 24M exactly as at the origin, the
 * wire is not the ceiling either, and "entity doubles degrade past ±2M" has nothing left holding it up
 * on any of its three legs.</p>
