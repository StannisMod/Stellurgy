/**
 * The sky a pilot actually SEES inside a space slot cell, measured in PIXELS off a real client.
 *
 * <p>Everything upstream of rasterization already had coverage: the server producer, the broadcast, and
 * the client store {@code PacketSystemBodiesSync.CLIENT_BODIES}. None of it could tell a pilot staring at
 * an empty sky which half was empty, because a primitive that is emitted and then discarded by the
 * rasterizer is indistinguishable from one that was never emitted. So this test looks at the frame.</p>
 *
 * <p>Honest client e2e: the stimulus is a real look ({@code set_look}) on the real client and the
 * observation is a real capture of the real framebuffer ({@code screenshot}). Delete the client and there
 * are no pixels to count. Server probes only arrange (register the slot, settle a ship, register the
 * bodies) and act as the cross-side oracle for what SHOULD be drawn, and where.</p>
 *
 * <h2>The subject is a real system, at real distances, on real bearings</h2>
 * The defect this test exists for was reported from a cell holding SIX bodies between 3 000 and 60 000
 * blocks on six different bearings, and an earlier version of this test proved only that ONE synthetic
 * body 1 000 blocks straight up could be drawn — a subject that could not exhibit the report. The bodies
 * below are the measured live set: five descend-target moons and a gas giant that is not one, at the live
 * distances, spread so that no two are within 45 degrees of each other. Two of them are then aimed at
 * INDIVIDUALLY, using the bearing the SERVER reports for them rather than one this test computed for
 * itself, because "the client drew something in the sky" and "the client drew the body where the server
 * put it" are different claims and only the second one lets a pilot fly at a moon.
 *
 * <h2>Which world the pilot is in is the SERVER's answer, not this test's</h2>
 * A cell is bound to a slot world by materializing it, and that binding is what the render feed is keyed
 * with. The slot the binding lands in is therefore read back off the settle, never chosen here: a number
 * picked by the test is a guess, and a guess that happens to agree would still pass on a build that keyed
 * the feed to the wrong world. (An earlier version guessed, put the pilot in a world its ship's cell was
 * not bound to, and reported the resulting blank sky as a production defect.)
 *
 * <h2>Why the harness needs three settings changed</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code setRenderDistance(8)} — vanilla runs the whole sky pass only when
 *       {@code renderDistanceChunks >= 4} ({@code EntityRenderer.renderWorldPass}); the harness pins it
 *       at 2, so without this the sky renderer never runs and every frame is honestly empty for the
 *       wrong reason. 8 also puts the sky far plane at 256, clear of the ~100-unit sky geometry.</li>
 *   <li>{@code setFramebuffer(true)} — without the FBO a capture reads a back buffer the driver may
 *       already have discarded. <b>Run this test with {@code -PclientFbo=true}</b>: enabling the FBO at
 *       RUNTIME is not enough, because the recreated framebuffer receives only the HUD pass and not the
 *       world pass, so every capture comes back as the framebuffer's own white clear colour. The
 *       liveness control below is what makes that failure loud instead of a false accusation against the
 *       renderer.</li>
 *   <li>{@code setHudHidden(true)} — the HUD is not part of the subject and actively corrupts it. The
 *       chat overlay carries the harness's own per-command completion markers, which sit across the
 *       middle of the frame and CHANGE between two captures. Hiding also drains toasts, which vanilla
 *       draws outside the hideGUI gate.</li>
 * </ul>
 * All three are restored afterwards.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here assumes a background colour</h2>
 * The world pass clears to the dimension's FOG colour, and for a slot dim that is
 * {@code fogColor * sunBrightness} — so it is white by day and dark by night, not the black the defect
 * report describes. Every measurement below is therefore expressed as "differs from the background this
 * frame actually has", with the background measured off the frame itself, and the world time is pinned
 * so it cannot drift mid-test.
 *
 * <h2>The measurements, and why none can be satisfied trivially</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Sky pass liveness (control, and it must run FIRST)</b> — the same capture pipeline pointed at
 *       a dimension whose sky is known-good: AR's own overworld sky, high enough that it renders as a
 *       starfield. If that frame is uniform, the sky pass is not running at all and every verdict below
 *       would be an empty frame blamed on production. This is what separates "the renderer draws
 *       nothing" from "the renderer is never called", and it has already earned its place twice — once
 *       catching a capture that held only the HUD, once catching an altitude-dependent sky.</li>
 *   <li><b>Each aimed body, by exact cancellation</b> — two captures from the IDENTICAL camera
 *       direction, one before any body exists and one after all six do. The sky here is camera-centred,
 *       so every other pixel (the starfield) is bit-identical between them and the differing pixels are
 *       the billboards and nothing else.</li>
 *   <li><b>The same aim vs an empty bearing</b> — a direction more than 100 degrees from every body in
 *       the cell (chosen by geometry, not by hope) must NOT gain a billboard when the bodies are
 *       registered, and must not look like the aimed frames do.</li>
 *   <li><b>The atmosphere boundary, by exact count</b> — one per DESCEND TARGET and none for anything
 *       else, read off the renderer's own per-frame counter. The fixture is what makes it a real
 *       measurement: six bodies of which five are descend targets, so "one per body" reads 6 and
 *       "none drawn" reads 0, and only the correct renderer reads 5.</li>
 *   <li><b>Starfield</b> — pixels differing from the background in the upper part of the empty-bearing
 *       frame, which holds no ring and no body, i.e. the cell is not an empty void.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Setup shortcuts, and what human action each replaces</h2>
 * A player reaches this view by flying a ship into space; the arrival settles it in the ledger and the
 * cell's contents come from the generated universe. Here {@code ledger-settle} injects the settled entry
 * and {@code add-poi} registers the bodies in the real universe registry. Both change only WHICH data the
 * producer has, not which object, frame or lifecycle stage the renderer reads — the renderer is fed
 * through the identical production broadcast — so the rendering path under test is the real one.
