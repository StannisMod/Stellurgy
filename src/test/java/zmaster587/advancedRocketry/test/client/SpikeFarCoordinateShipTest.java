/**
 * SPIKE — does a tier-2 ship survive a far world coordinate the way a bare player does?
 *
 * <p>A player walks, stands, collides, holds a sub-block position and is rendered without a quantum
 * out to 24M. None of that transfers: a ship's blocks live in the shipyard subspace while its pose
 * lives in the world, and the two are bridged by a transform of its own. So the ship is the last
 * subject that could still move the ratified half-cell, and this is the leg that measures it.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why this ASSEMBLES at the coordinate instead of teleporting a ship to it</h2>
 * {@code VSShipExtremeCoordinatesE2ETest} reached extreme <b>Y</b> by rigid-teleporting an assembled
 * ship, and left the extreme-|X| leg unautomated for a reason recorded in its own javadoc: after a
 * SECOND relocation the physics goes inert — neither a pilot key nor a velocity setpoint moves the
 * ship — and the pilot-key path dies after a dismount and re-seat across the map. Those are
 * relocation-SEQUENCE findings. Teleporting to |X| would re-run straight into them and produce a red
 * that says nothing about the coordinate.
 *
 * <p>So the stimulus changes rather than the measurement: the fixture is built, and the ship
 * assembled, AT the far coordinate. There is exactly one relocation in the whole leg — the player's,
 * through {@code far-tp} — and the ship is never moved at all.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Where the arena sits, and why</h2>
 * {@code Z = }{@value #ARENA_Z}, below the physics mod's reserved quadrant
 * ({@code chunkX >= 318401 && chunkZ >= -1599}). Above that Z the quadrant would swallow the arena at
 * 16M: the blocks would be shipyard blocks, the player's delivery would be cancelled silently, and
 * the leg would measure the reservation instead of the coordinate.
 *
 * <h2>Acceptance, stated before the run</h2>
 * The {@code x = 0} rung is the control, assembled and flown in the same run by the same commands.
 * At every rung:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>assembly must produce a VS ship (the ship count rises), and it must LOAD ({@code managed});</li>
 *   <li>the pilot seat must be findable and mountable — crew retention through the far assembly;</li>
 *   <li>a real held vertical-up key must lift the server ship by more than
 *       {@value #MIN_LIFT_BLOCKS} block;</li>
 *   <li>the CLIENT-rendered rider must track that climb to within {@value #TRACK_TOLERANCE} blocks —
 *       a transform that has lost precision shows up here as divergence, and nowhere earlier.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Designed to come back NO.</b> A ship that will not assemble, will not load, will not lift or
 * whose rider drifts at 16M is a finding against the ratified half-cell, and the number moves.</p>

     * SPIKE — how long does a ONE-SHOT commanded setpoint survive, and does the shipyard's position
     * change that?
     *
     * <h2>The question this exists to settle</h2>
     * Two measurements of this tree disagree. Moving the shipyard to {@code CHUNK_X_START =
     * 1,200,000} makes {@code aStillCrewMemberOnAFastClimbingShipKeepsHisCapture} report
     * {@code travelled=0.0} on 3 of 3 runs while it is green on 3 of 3 at {@code 320000} — yet the
     * ladder above lifts a ship 4.7–5.1 blocks at that same subspace magnitude. Both cannot be
     * describing "a ship cannot move out there".
     *
     * <p>They stop disagreeing under one hypothesis: the failure is not in DELIVERING a command but
     * in its SURVIVAL. The ladder holds a real key, so it re-commands every tick and outlives any
     * loss of state; {@code seat-input} writes a setpoint ONCE, into
     * {@code TileAdvancedFlightComputer} — and a flight computer tile that is re-created underneath
     * the ship loses every live field it holds, {@code velocitySetpoint} included, while persistent
     * {@code stationKeeping} survives. A command that is silently dropped a few seconds in reads as
     * {@code travelled=0.0}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Independently, the registration is known to leak in this tree:
     * {@code ClaimedChunkCacheController:122} re-registers EVERY tile of a chunk each time the claim
     * cache loads it, {@code MixinChunk:48} adds on tile add, and {@code MixinChunk:53} removes only
     * when a tile is genuinely removed — so an unload/load cycle leaves the old instance registered
     * forever and adds a new one.</p>
     *
     * <h2>What this measures, and what would settle it</h2>
     * One command, then the ship's own position sampled until it stops moving. The number is the
     * SURVIVAL WINDOW in ticks. Run at both constants, on a wiped world, at ordinary world
     * coordinates so the shipyard's position is the only thing that differs.
     * <ul>
     *   <li>window shorter at {@code 1,200,000} → the two measurements are reconciled and the
     *       shipyard move is implicated through the recreation rate;</li>
     *   <li>window the same → the recreation story is still true but does NOT explain the red, and
     *       the cause of that red is still unnamed.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Prints, never asserts a threshold: there is no defensible number to assert before the first
     * pair of readings exists.
