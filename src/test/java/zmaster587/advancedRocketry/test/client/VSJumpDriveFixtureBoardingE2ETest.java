/**
 * A jump-capable craft assembles WHOLE, and a pilot standing on its deck can reach both of the
 * blocks he has to touch by hand: the pilot seat and the navigation console.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> The hyperjump craft is the first AR build whose player-facing surface is
 * two separate blocks aboard an assembled physics ship — you sit down in one and open a GUI on the
 * other. Every earlier ship test needed only the seat, so the fixture that carries the drive never
 * had anywhere to stand: a pilot on the launch pad squints up at the hull from four blocks below,
 * which is inside the range where the physics mod's raytrace silently discards a ship hit (it keeps
 * one only when it is STRICTLY nearer than the vanilla world result, and at the end of reach the two
 * tie). This test is what pins the reworked deck-based fixture: one square on the deck from which
 * both consoles are one block away, face-on.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Two things are measured, in this order.</b></p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Every drive component actually joined the ship.</b> Assembly returning {@code ok} says
 *       nothing about which blocks came with it: the physics mod grows a ship by flood-filling out
 *       of the flight computer, so a machine that is only diagonally reachable is left standing on
 *       the pad, and the craft flies away without it. Two independent legs, because either alone
 *       can be fooled: the block is READ at its own address in the ship's subspace (and its pad cell
 *       is empty), and the ship's own drive/navigation layers are asked what they can SEE from the
 *       flight computer.</li>
 *   <li><b>Both consoles answer a real key press</b> — the same aim-and-press the human performs,
 *       through the same code path, with the crosshair confirmed on the intended block before every
 *       press so a red names the hop that failed rather than merely the outcome.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Assembly here is ARRANGEMENT, not subject: it is driven by the probe.</p>
 *
 * <p>On the shared VS client base. It ran its own server + client pair per method until 2026-08-23,
 * "matching the other ship-boarding e2e tests" — a reason to resemble its neighbours, never a reason
 * to boot: its root was a fresh empty temp dir handed to a harness that makes one of those itself,
 * and nothing was written into it before the server started. Off the shared base an arrangement
 * failure here could not be TYPED as one either, and that is the half that mattered.</p>
