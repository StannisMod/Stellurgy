/**
 * A mount entity is the SAME entity on both sides.
 *
 * <p>Sitting on a chair spawns a mount entity that the server owns and the client must rebuild as
 * itself. When it does not, nothing reports an error: the client silently builds some other
 * registered class, is handed the sender's synced fields BY SLOT INDEX, and the first read of a
 * slot whose type no longer matches takes the whole client to the crash screen mid-tick. From the
 * player's side that is the worst failure this mod can produce, and it needs no command and no
 * unusual action — only sitting down.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this must be a client test.</b> The defect lives only on the receiving side: the
 * server's own view is correct and every server-tier query agrees with itself. The subject is what
 * the CLIENT rebuilt, so only the client can answer.
 *
 * <p><b>Why an ordinary chair on the ground.</b> The mix-up is a property of the entity numbering
 * this jar ships, not of any ship: a plain chair mounts through the same spawn path, with no
 * physics object, no assembly and no timing window, so the reproduction is deterministic. The
 * riding report is its own control — {@code riding=true} means the mount did reach the client, so
 * a wrong class cannot be explained away as "the client never saw it".
