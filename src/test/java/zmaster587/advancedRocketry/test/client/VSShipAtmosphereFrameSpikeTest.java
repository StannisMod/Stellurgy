/**
 * Spike — in WHICH coordinate frame does an oxygen vent seal, once its blocks belong to an
 * assembled Valkyrien Skies ship, and does the crew's own breathe gate resolve against that seal?
 *
 * <p>Two identical sealed cabins are built and pressurised in the same run:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Control — static world.</b> A cabin on the ground, far from any ship. It proves the
 *       instrument is sensitive: the vent seals, the position query reports
 *       {@code PressurizedAir}, and the player standing inside it has that atmosphere cached by
 *       the per-entity gate. Without this leg an "air" reading on the ship leg would be
 *       unfalsifiable — it could equally mean the vent, the probe or the cache never worked.</li>
 *   <li><b>Subject — aboard an assembled ship.</b> The same cabin built at the ship's SUBSPACE
 *       addresses, its vent sealed there, then queried twice: at the subspace cell, and at the
 *       WORLD cell the same cabin actually occupies (mapped through the live ship transform).
 *       The player is teleported into that world cell — physically inside the pressurised
 *       cabin — and his cached atmosphere is read back.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The subject can falsify the premise: if the blob were built (or re-keyed) in world
 * coordinates, the world-cell query and the aboard player would both report {@code PressurizedAir}
 * and no ship-frame conversion would be needed at the gate at all. The run prints every raw
 * payload, and each assertion carries them, so a red is a finished measurement rather than the
 * start of one.</p>
 *
 *
 * <p><b>What it measured (2026-07-26).</b> The vent seals identically in both frames
 * ({@code blobSize=28} on the ground and aboard), so a ship's own blocks seal normally; the blob's
 * member cells are the ship's SUBSPACE addresses ({@code 5120005,129,51200} &rarr;
 * {@code PressurizedAir}), while the WORLD cell the same cabin occupies ({@code 5207,70,5203})
 * reports the dimension default, and a player standing inside that pressurised cabin resolves
 * {@code air} — against {@code PressurizedAir} for the identical cabin on the ground. The
 * assertions therefore pin the CURRENT behaviour: when the atmosphere gate learns to resolve in
 * the ship frame this test goes red and must be rewritten to the new contract.</p>
