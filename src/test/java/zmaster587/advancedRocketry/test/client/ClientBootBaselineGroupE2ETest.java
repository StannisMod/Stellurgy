/**
 * Everything that is true of a booted client before any feature is exercised: the bridge answers,
 * the mod list agrees with itself, and the harness client is silent.
 *
 * <h2>Why these three share one harness</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each was a single-method class, and each spent better than 95 % of its wall clock booting a
 * server and a client in order to ask one question of them. Measured 2026-08-07 on the maintainer's
 * box at 8 forks, from the result XML: {@code ClientConnectSmokeTest} 115.2 s,
 * {@code ModCountParityE2ETest} 107.9 s, {@code TestClientSoundMutedE2ETest} 76.1 s — three boots,
 * three client JVMs, ~5 minutes of machine time for three assertions that between them take
 * seconds.</p>
 *
 * <p>They also share a property none of the other groups has: <b>not one of them mutates anything.</b>
 * No block is placed, no item given, no dimension entered, no global flipped. That makes this the
 * safest possible group and the natural seed for a smoke lane — if these three are red, nothing else
 * in the tier can mean anything, and the rest of the run is wasted machine time.</p>
 *
 * <p>Source classes, merged verbatim (method names preserved so CI history greps):
 * {@code ClientConnectSmokeTest}, {@code ModCountParityE2ETest},
 * {@code TestClientSoundMutedE2ETest}.</p>
