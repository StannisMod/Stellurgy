/**
 * Destroying a piloted ship's control station RELEASES the ship instead of latching it. Two
 * destruction targets, each its own contract:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The occupied pilot seat</b>: the rider is dismounted, the seat's mount dummy is
 *       removed, and the flight computer drops the pilot's last input AND his cruise setpoint —
 *       the ship reverts to an unmanned station-hold. Without that, the computer executes the last
 *       command every tick and (with Flight Assist ramping the cruise) the ship becomes an
 *       uncontrollable runaway accelerating away with nobody at the controls.</li>
 *   <li><b>The linked flight computer</b>: the pilot is dismounted, told the computer is gone
 *       (action bar), the dummy removed — and the dead computer's command channels die with it, so
 *       nothing keeps thrusting a brainless ship.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Full honest path: a real client pilot (real held key → packet → seat → computer → force)
 * flies the ship; the break is a server-side block removal exactly like a mined block (the same
 * {@code breakBlock} path); every outcome is read from the CLIENT (riding state, entity presence,
 * the action-bar overlay) with the server ship position as the motion oracle.
