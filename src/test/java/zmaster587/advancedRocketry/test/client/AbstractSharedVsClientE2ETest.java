/**
 * The shared-client base for the Valkyrien Skies / tier-2 ship scenarios.
 *
 * <p>It is a separate base class and not two more commands in {@link AbstractSharedClientE2ETest}
 * because that class's reset is paid by every scenario in the client tier, and the two channels
 * below belong to ship scenarios only.</p>
 *
 * <h2>The three channels a ship scenario leaves behind</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>The player is still RIDING.</b> Nearly every scenario here ends seated on a pilot seat's
 *       dummy or captured by a deck. A passenger is not moved by {@code /tp}, so without this the
 *       shared reset's plot assertion fails naming coordinates — the symptom, not the cause — and a
 *       scenario that opens by mounting would mount a seat it is already sitting on.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@code vs permaload}.</b> The headless affordance that keeps a freshly assembled ship
 *       loaded with no player to hold it. Several scenarios switch it on and never switch it off,
 *       which hands the next scenario a world where ships never unload — and a scenario whose
 *       subject IS the unload (a reload, a client-load gate) would then silently measure the
 *       affordance instead of the product. It is reset to OFF, so a scenario that needs it SETS
 *       it.</li>
 *   <li><b>The flight computer's probe command channels.</b> They are per-tile and name one ship
 *       each, so they cannot bleed onto a neighbour — but they deliberately OUTRANK the pilot
 *       channel, so one left in force hands the next scenario a computer that ignores its own pilot.
 *       They replaced four {@code static volatile} channels that every computer read as a fallback,
 *       where a probe throttle was not aimed at the ship it named at all: it kept flying every other
 *       ship in the world, including the next
 *       scenario's, until something cleared it. Under one boot per test there was never a next
 *       scenario, which is why this only surfaced here.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Both are closed and then ASSERTED, on the same principle as the base reset: a reset nobody
 * checks is indistinguishable from no reset.</p>

     * How far from its query point a {@code vs ship-info} answer may be and still be attributed to
     * THIS scenario, in blocks — <b>for the CAPTURE only</b>.
     *
     * <p>{@code vs ship-info <dim> <x> <y> <z>} is a NEAREST-ship lookup
     * ({@code VSBridge.nearestShip}) — it reports whichever loaded ship is closest to the point, and
     * until this constant existed it had no distance bound at all. With one ship in the world that
     * is exact. With several, it answers with a NEIGHBOUR the moment this scenario's ship unloads or
     * flies off, and the reply is indistinguishable from a correct one: the caller gets a plausible
     * position, attitude and angular velocity belonging to a ship it never built.</p>
     *
     * <p>48 is chosen against the tier's own geometry: these classes space their fixtures <b>100
     * blocks</b> apart, so a bound below 50 can never admit a neighbour.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>It is not, and cannot be, an identity.</b> The distance {@code nearestShip} compares is
     * the full 3-D one, Y included, and this tier's flight scenarios climb on purpose — one holds
     * the lift key for 60 uninterrupted ticks to clear the terrain, which at the flight model's cap
     * is over a hundred blocks. Bounded, every later query about that ship answers
     * {@code managed:false}; unbounded, it answers about the neighbour. Neither is a report about
     * the ship the scenario built.</p>

     * defensible — the scenario's own ship freshly assembled at its own base, before anything has
     * moved — and everything afterwards goes through {@link #shipInfoById}, which has no distance
