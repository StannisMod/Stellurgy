 * <p>These are the control legs of the restore. Without them, "everybody ends up on a ship" passes

     * The other end of the restore: when the server genuinely has no record of a returning pilot's
     * ship, he is TOLD so — not silently stood up at his spawn point wondering where his ship went.
     *
     * <p>This is a client test for the only reason that matters: the subject is a line of text a
     * player reads. The server can be asked whether it decided he was orphaned; it cannot be asked
     * whether he was informed. The bot's own chat log can.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Why the ship is removed rather than the ledger damaged.</b> "The ledger has no such ship"
     * is one verdict reached from several directions — a ship dismantled while its owner was away, a
     * descent that took it out of the subsystem, a durable record that failed to come back. The
     * player's side of it is identical in every case, and the removal is the one direction that is
     * both production behaviour and arrangeable, so the arrangement asserts the ledger KNEW the ship
     * first: a "he was told his ship is missing" that came from a ship the server never had would be
     * a statement about the fixture.</p>
     *
     * <p>A relog is enough and is deliberate — the decision is made when a player's save file is read,
     * which a rejoin does as faithfully as a reboot, and it keeps the ship, the cell and the ledger in
     * one server's lifetime where the arrangement can still speak about them.</p>
