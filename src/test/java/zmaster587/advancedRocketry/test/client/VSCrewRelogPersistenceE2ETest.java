     * rate, with no input at all.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Why this leg exists, and why it is on a planet.</b> The maintainer reported being dragged
     * along his deck after a login in space, on a ship that was inverted. His own session log named the
     * mechanism: the external-move guard released the deck capture 25 times in ~50 s with
     * {@code externalMove(sub)} deltas up to 0.43 blocks/tick against its 0.2-block slack, while the
     * ship's attitude was settling at a 53.6 deg tilt - and between the release and the re-capture the
     * body belongs to vanilla and the physics mod, so it slides. The guard's own javadoc names this case
     * in advance: the slack absorbs "about one tick of ship motion at the body's radius from the
     * rotation centre ... a far-from-centre pilot on a violently spinning ship is the one case where it
     * could still approach the slack".</p>
     *
     * <p>So the DRIVER is ship rotation at radius - not the space cell, not the relog, not the login
     * restore, all of which merely accompanied it in the report. Reproducing the driver puts the subject
     * where rolling a ship is already proven to work, and it removes three variables from the
     * arrangement. A space-cell version would additionally need a way to rotate a ship inside a cell,
     * which the harness currently does not have.</p>
     *
     * <p>The idle window before the roll is the control: the guard must be quiet while nothing rotates,
     * or a count taken during the roll is not attributable to the roll.</p>
