/**
 * Real-client end-to-end coverage for Free Flight Mode.
 *
 * <p>This boots both a dedicated server (via {@link AbstractClientE2ETest})
 * and a real MC client bot that connects in. The bot acts as a passenger;
 * server-side probes flip flight mode, push FF input, and the real server
 * tick loop runs {@code tickFreeFlight} on the live entity. The bot polls
 * the rocket entity through {@code /artest rocket info} to assert the
 * cross-side replication is coherent.
 *
 * Verified cross-side contracts:
 *  - Bot can mount a freshly-assembled rocket via {@code player mount-entity}.
 *  - Server-side flight-mode flip is observable via {@code rocket info}
 *    (which reads the field that NBT-roundtrips and is replicated through
 *    the datawatcher branch on subsequent state changes).
 *  - {@code start-free-flight} flips {@code isInFlight=true} without a chip.
 *  - Once airborne with non-zero throttle, server tick loop produces a
 *    cumulative motion delta over a 40-tick window.
 *  - The bot's reportState confirms the player is still riding the rocket
 *    AFTER ticks: the FF tick must NOT eject the passenger.
 *
 * <p>The client-side keypress&rarr;packet&rarr;server input wiring is unit-tested
 * via {@code FreeFlightInputTest} (ByteBuf round-trip with re-clamping) and
 * pinned indirectly here: the same {@code FREE_FLIGHT_INPUT} packet that
 * keybinds emit on real key events is what {@code free-flight-input} probe
 * dispatches server-side. A regression in the wire format would surface in
 * one of those two layers.
 *
 * Gated by {@code -Dforge.test.client=true}; skipped on headless CI.
 *
 * <h2>Shared harness</h2>
 *
 * <p>This class is the single largest item in the client tier: 27 scenarios, each of which used to
 * boot its own dedicated-server JVM AND its own Minecraft client — about 27 x 110 s in ONE gradle
 * fork, which made it the wall-clock FLOOR of the whole tier while the other seven forks idled.
 * It now runs on one shared harness.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two things made the migration safe rather than merely cheap:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The lane is not moved.</b> These scenarios build on GROUND at y=64, so they inherit
 *       whatever the fixed seed generated. The x=3000.. / z=500 strip is what every green run of
 *       this file was taken on; relocating it onto the shared-harness default would have been a
 *       change of subject dressed as a refactor. See {@link #lane()}.</li>
 *   <li><b>The rocket is found by PLOT, not by "the last one in the world".</b> The old
 *       {@code buildAndAssemble} read {@code artest rocket list 0} and took the highest id it saw.
 *       That is safe when the world holds exactly one rocket and silently wrong when it holds 27 —
 *       precisely the object-answers-for-another-object failure a shared world creates. The lookup
 *       now filters on {@link Plot#contains}.</li>
 * </ul>
