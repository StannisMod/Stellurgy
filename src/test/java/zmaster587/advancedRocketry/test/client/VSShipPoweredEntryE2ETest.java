/**
 * A pilot who flies his ship through the atmosphere ceiling UNDER HIS OWN POWER must arrive in the
 * space cell still seated, not falling, and still in control.
 *
 * <p>This is the first test in which a ship reaches the entry line by climbing rather than by a
 * probe or a teleport - the full production on-ramp: a real client on the pilot seat holds the real
 * vertical-up key, the flight computer's own tick notices the ship above the dimension's orbit
 * line, the entry crossing cuts the ship out of the launch world and re-assembles it in a slot
 * cell, and the crew transfer carries the seated pilot across. Every earlier entry test started
 * the crossing artificially, so nothing ever verified the seam a player actually flies through.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What the arrival assertions pin.</b> After a granted entry, measured from what the CLIENT
 * itself renders: (1) the client's own world is a space-subsystem slot dimension; (2) the pilot is
 * STILL riding his seat mount - crossing a dimension seam must never stand him up; (3) he is NOT
 * in free fall at the arrival pose; (4) holding the vertical-up key again lifts the arrived ship -
 * the control chain survived the crossing onto the re-assembled ship's fresh seat binding; (5) he
 * carries the durable aboard record that a logout in space depends on. A
 * play-tested failure of this seam reported exactly the inverse: the pilot off his ship, falling,
 * in a black cell. Whether the cell LOOKS right on screen stays a manual check - pixels are out of
 * scope here; the mechanical claims are not.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Arrangement.</b> The orbit line is seeded to the config minimum (255) so the powered climb
 * is seconds, not minutes - the trigger predicate is the same whatever the number. An in-run
 * control leg first proves plain flight works at all (a short climb far below the line), so a red
 * on the entry leg indicts the crossing, not the cockpit. All wait budgets scale with the harness
 * load factor and exit early, so the test is parallel-gate-safe by construction.</p>
 *
 * <p>Manual server + client lifecycle: the config must be written into the game directory BEFORE
 * the server boots. Gated on real Valkyrien Skies - run with {@code -PwithVS}.</p>
