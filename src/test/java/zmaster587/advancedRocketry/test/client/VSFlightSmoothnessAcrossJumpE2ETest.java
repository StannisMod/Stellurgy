/**
 * Does a ship fly as SMOOTHLY after a jump as it did before one?
 *
 * <p>The report this test exists for is a pilot's: after the first jump the craft "flies in jerks",
 * in a cell and back over a planet alike. Nothing in the session log could see it — the log records
 * what the game DECIDED, and a jerk is not a decision, it is a distribution: the same held key, the
 * same commanded velocity, and a clock somewhere underneath that stopped arriving evenly.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the answer needs four clocks, not one.</b> A ship's motion passes through the physics
 * loop's own thread (where the velocity integrates), the server world tick (where the command is
 * republished), the client tick (where the arriving pose is smoothed) and the rendered frame (where
 * the pilot finally sees it). Each of those can stutter alone, they are fixed by different things,
 * and a measurement on only one of them cannot tell which. So both legs below read all four, and
 * the failure message carries every one — a red here should say WHICH clock broke, not merely that
 * something did.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The control is the same ship, minutes earlier.</b> A smoothness number has no absolute
 * meaning: it depends on the box, the fork count, the ship's mass. So the pre-jump leg is not
 * arrangement — it is the control arm, flown by the same pilot holding the same key on the same
 * craft in a cell it reached the same way. What the post-jump leg is measured against is that, and
 * a green means "the jump did not make it worse", which is exactly the reported claim's negation.
 * Both legs also carry their own stimulus control: a craft that never moved reads as perfectly
 * smooth, so each leg asserts it actually flew before it is allowed to say anything about how.</p>
 *
 * <p></p>
