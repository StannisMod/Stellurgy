/**
 * SPIKE — is the render actually quantized far from the origin, the thing the 4M cell was sized for?
 *
 * <p>The cell used to be 4,000,000 blocks, justified with "entity doubles / chunks / lighting degrade
 * past ~±2M blocks in 1.12.2". The server half of that (chunk generation, block storage) measured
 * CLEAN out to 28M. This measures the visual half.
 *
 * <h2>The stimulus, and why it is motion rather than a still frame</h2>
 * A float quantum does not produce a shimmer in a static scene — the error is CONSTANT, so a still
 * camera at 16M renders a still (if slightly displaced) image. Quantization shows up when the camera
 * moves by LESS than the quantum: the frame then refuses to change until the accumulated motion
 * crosses one step. So the camera is walked in {@value #STEP_BLOCKS}-block increments and the metric
 * is <b>how many consecutive frames come back byte-identical</b>.
 *
 * <p>Expected, if the render path carried absolute coordinates in float: at ±2M the quantum is 0.25
 * block, so ~5 frames repeat per step; at ±16M it is 2 blocks, so ~40 repeat. Expected, if the path
 * subtracts the viewer position in double before casting (which is what
 * {@code RenderManager.renderEntityStatic} and Valkyrien Skies' {@code PhysObjectRenderManager} both
 * appear to do): zero repeats at every coordinate.
 *
 * <h2>Two controls, because this instrument has a known way of lying</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>The capture must contain a scene.</b> A framebuffer enabled at RUNTIME receives the HUD
 *       pass and not the world pass, so every capture comes back as the clear colour — which reads
 *       exactly like "the renderer drew nothing". The client must be started with
 *       {@code -PclientFbo=true}, and the first frame is checked for being more than one flat colour.</li>
 *   <li><b>The scene must be STATIC.</b> Two captures with no motion between them must be identical.
 *       If they are not, something in the frame is animating and "frames differ" can no longer mean
 *       "the camera moved" — the run is inconclusive and says so rather than producing a number.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Why the first run of this class stopped at 4M, and why that was not the render</h2>
 * It delivered with plain {@code /tp} into an arena at {@code Z = 0}. The physics mod cancels,
 * silently, any teleport into its reserved shipyard quadrant — {@code chunkX >= 318401 && chunkZ >=
 * -1599}, i.e. <b>X ≥ 5,094,416 and Z ≥ -25,584</b> — while the command still reports success. Every
 * rung from 8M up was therefore refused by a mod constant, and the camera never left the previous
 * coordinate. The arena now sits at {@code Z = }{@value #ARENA_Z}, below the quadrant's Z edge, and
 * the long jump between rungs goes through {@code /artest player far-tp} (vanilla's own
 * dimension-change path, which is how a long jump escapes the speed check). The sub-block camera
 * steps stay on plain {@code /tp}: they are not long jumps, and they are outside the quadrant.
 *
 * <p>Designed to come back NO: if every coordinate shows zero repeats, the render is not the ceiling
 * and the cell bound has to be justified by something else or dropped.</p>
