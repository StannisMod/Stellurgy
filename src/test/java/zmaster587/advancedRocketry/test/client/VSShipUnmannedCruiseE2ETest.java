/**
 * Flight Assist is an AUTOPILOT, not a dead-man switch: the FA state (mode + cruise setpoint) is a
 * SETTING the ship keeps executing when the pilot leaves his seat. A pilot who ramps a cruise with
 * a real held key and then dismounts leaves a ship that KEEPS CRUISING at that setpoint — it must
 * not brake to a hover the moment nobody is seated (that behaviour made the "autopilot" a
 * per-tick input echo). Re-mounting must not interrupt or reset the executing cruise either — the
 * saved setting is the pilot's to come back to.
 *
 * <p>Full honest path: the cruise is ramped by a REAL held key on the real client; the dismount
 * and re-mount are player actions (probe-driven where the harness cannot right-click a subspace
 * seat); the ship's continued motion is the server oracle. The zero-setpoint degenerate case
 * (station-hold, "the hovering ship fell" fix) stays pinned by the existing flight suite. Gated
 * on real VS —</p>
