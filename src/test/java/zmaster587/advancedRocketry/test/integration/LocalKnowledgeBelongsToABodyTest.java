/**
 * What a BODY knows, as opposed to what the game knows.
 *
 * <p>Discovery used to have exactly one store: a global set that a beacon or the planet XML wrote
 * into, which every launch pad in every world read. A telescope survey wrote nothing into it, so a
 * player could chart a system, fly there with a ship, and still not be offered that planet by a
 * tier-1 rocket standing on the ground.</p>
 *
 * <p>The contract these tests pin is that knowledge is a property of the PLACE: what one body has
 * learned does not leak to its neighbour, the global set remains a floor under every body rather
 * than being replaced, and a body's learning survives a save/load. They deliberately do not pin who
 * WRITES the set - an observatory, a beacon and a crystal upload are separate mechanics with their
 * own tests - only that a body has one and that it is asked.</p>
