 * jump is a duration the game can contain at all, and it is asked before any server boots because a
 * number this large is cheaper to falsify on paper.</p>

 * <p>What is pinned here is SHAPE, never the numbers: the spacing guarantee the generator promises,
 * and that a farther cell costs strictly more ticks than a nearer one. Every constant it reads —
 * spacing, density, drive power, speed — is a balance knob, and a test that pinned one would fail
