/**
 * Contract tests for what is out there in the INTERGALACTIC VOID: rogue worlds, rogue stars, and the
 * globulars that were thrown clear of a galaxy. Pure JUnit; no MC bootstrap.
 *
 * <p>The void's content is not a second placement rule. It is the SAME star lattice, drawn a second
 * time against the SAME material function — the galaxy's own profile where there is a galaxy, and its
 * ejecta halo where there is not. So the contracts here are about that one function's shape and about
 * what a starless system is, never about the numbers either of them happens to be tuned to.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Sampling is by SUPER-CELL and the sweeps are large.</b> Out past a galaxy's edge the occupancy
 * is percent-scale, so a sweep of a few dozen cubes finds nothing whatever the model says. Where a
 * count would need thousands of samples to be stable, the test reads the PROFILE instead, which is
 * exact and is the thing the contract is actually about.</p>
