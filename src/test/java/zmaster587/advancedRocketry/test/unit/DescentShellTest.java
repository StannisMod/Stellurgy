/**
 * The range a pilot is shown counts down to the surface he crosses.
 *
 * <p>The contract is not "subtract a constant" — it is that <b>the number reaches zero exactly when
 * the crossing happens</b>. That is why the legs below do not check arithmetic against itself: they
 * check the readout against {@link zmaster587.advancedRocketry.space.DescentController} the mechanic,
 * so a change to either that leaves them disagreeing is red. A test that only asserted
 * {@code max(0, d - R)} would pass just as happily on a build where the trigger fired at some other
 * radius, and the defect this exists for is precisely a readout describing a different surface from
 * the one the game acts on.</p>
