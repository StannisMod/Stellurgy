/**
 * What the jump window promises: a generator can carry a small ship on its own, emitters are how a
 * big hull gets to travel in one piece, and a hull that does not fit is <b>measured</b> rather than
 * guessed at.
 *
 * <p>The last one is the sharp edge. A window is a union of envelopes, and a union of envelopes is
 * not an envelope: a hull can lie entirely inside the box that bounds two emitters while poking
 * straight through the gap between them. A coverage check that tested the bounding box would call
 * that ship covered and shear nothing — so the test below builds exactly that shape.</p>
