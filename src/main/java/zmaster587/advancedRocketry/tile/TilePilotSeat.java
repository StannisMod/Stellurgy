 * ({@link #linkToFlightComputer}). That relative offset is invariant under the rigid
 * translation the physics mod applies when it relocates the craft into a ship (the ship's

 * computer with a plain {@code getTileEntity} at {@code seatPos + offset} — no physics-mod type
 * is referenced here, keeping the soft dependency intact.</p>
 *
 * <p>Control flow: the piloting client samples its Free Flight input each tick and sends it to
 * this seat as a {@code PacketMachine}; server-side {@link #useNetworkData} forwards it to the
 * linked computer's {@link TileAdvancedFlightComputer#setPilotInput}. The computer's own server
