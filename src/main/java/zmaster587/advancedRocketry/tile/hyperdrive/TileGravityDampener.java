/**
 * What stands between a crew and the bulkhead when a jump ends the wrong way.
 *
 * <p>Arriving where you meant to costs nobody anything. A window that collapses mid-flight does not
 * ask: the transit's speed has to go somewhere, and without a dampener it goes into everybody
 * aboard. A powered dampener eats that speed up to what it is built to eat; whatever is left over is
 * what the crew feels.</p>
 *
 * <p>Reach is the second lever, and it is why one dampener is not an answer for every ship. A
 * dampener protects who is near it, so a hull big enough to need several needs several.</p>
 *
 * <p>It holds a small energy buffer rather than drawing per tick: what matters is that it has power
 * at the single instant the window fails, and a buffer is what makes that true for a ship whose
 * generators are on the far side of a battle.</p>
