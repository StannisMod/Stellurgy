 * The ship's hyperspace field generator: the machine that decides how deep a well the ship can climb
 * out of, how fast it crosses, and how big a burst it takes to get going.
 *
 * <p>Its power is not a tier stamped on the block — it is <b>measured</b>, by walking the coils
 * welded to it. That is the progression the whole family is built around: a bigger generator is a
 * better generator, and "bigger" is something a player builds rather than something he unlocks.</p>
 *
 * <p>A generator is not a window on its own, but it does hold up a small one, so a first ship with
 * nothing but a generator, a capacitor and a navigation computer can still jump. Hull emitters are
 * what make the window big enough for a hull worth the name.</p>
