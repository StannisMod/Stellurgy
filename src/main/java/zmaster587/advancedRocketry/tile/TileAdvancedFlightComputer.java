 *
 * <p>The launch-pad assembler decides a craft's tier from its content: a build
 * that contains an Advanced Flight Computer is assembled into a walk-on, physics
 * driven ship; without one it stays an ordinary rocket. Naming is deliberately
 * distinct from the Guidance Computer and other on-board computers so the two are
 * never confused in code or GUI.</p>
 *
 * <p>On a tier-2 ship this tile is the flight computer: a seated pilot's Free Flight
 * input, plus the ship's own attitude read back from the physics mod, drive a
 * velocity setpoint on the ship. That control loop lands in a later phase; the only
 * state persisted here is the pilot's Flight-Assist on/off choice (per the design,
 * the ship remembers only its FA setting — the velocity setpoint is captured live
 * on enable, and the engine-start ritual is not persisted). All physics-mod calls
 * stay behind the optional integration gate, so this class never hard-depends on it.</p>
