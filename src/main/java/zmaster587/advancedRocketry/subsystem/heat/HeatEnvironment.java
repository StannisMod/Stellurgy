 * channel. Nothing gets a mechanism of its own, which is what stops the environment growing a special
 * case per source and is why a heat weapon needs no new pathway to exist: it adds to this sum.
 * <p>
 * <b>This is the term that used to be a constant.</b> Rejection is written {@code T⁴ − T_amb⁴}, and
 * {@code k·A·T_amb⁴} is an incident flux spelled as a temperature. Feeding that subtraction a config
 * number meant a radiator in deep space was radiating against a room, which cost it roughly half its
 * strength; there is now nothing to feed, because the second half of the subtraction is what this
 * class computes.
 * <p>
 * <b>It couples through the radiators and nowhere else.</b> A radiating cell is the ship's deliberate
 * high-emissivity surface, so it absorbs as well as sheds; a hull does neither. A ship with no
 * radiators therefore does not heat in a star, and shutting the sinks is protection as well as
 * silence.
