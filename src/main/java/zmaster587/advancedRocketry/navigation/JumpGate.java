/**
 * Whether a ship may jump, and what the pilot should be told if it may not.
 *
 * <p>The gate is <b>free and read-only</b>: asking costs nothing and consumes nothing, so a refusal is
 * never a loss. Everything expensive happens after it, at the trigger's commit point.</p>
 *
 * <p>It answers in <b>two tiers</b>, because not every objection is a veto:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Severity#HARD} — physically impossible. The jump does not happen.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Severity#ADVISORY} — possible but ill-advised. The pilot is told what is wrong and may
 *       confirm anyway; flying into a bad idea on purpose is a decision the game leaves to him.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The gate is a <b>composite</b>: this class owns the clauses every jump has (a nav computer
 * aboard, a known position, a target, a drive, the burst that opens the window, the energy for the
 * flight) and the fixed order of the stages, while later subsystems register their own predicates
 * into the stage that belongs to them. Order matters only for which message the pilot reads first —
 * every predicate is free, so all of them run.</p>
