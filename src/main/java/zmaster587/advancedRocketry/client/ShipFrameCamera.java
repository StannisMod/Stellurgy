 *
 * <p>Vanilla assumes a body's up is the world's up. It adds the eye height along world {@code +Y}
 * ({@code EntityRenderer.orientCamera}) and rotates a model by yaw alone
 * ({@code RenderLivingBase.applyRotations}). On an inverted ship the first puts the pilot's eye inside
 * the deck above his seat, so nothing renders at all; the second leaves the crew standing sideways out
 * of the hull.</p>
 *
 * <p>The physics mod corrects both, but only for entities it considers <em>mounted</em> to a ship - its
 * own seat concept, which AR's pilot dummy is not. So AR supplies them.</p>
