/**
 * The corridor a ship flies down while it is in hyperspace.
 *
 * <p>A transit has no controls, no bodies in the sky and no number counting down, so without this
 * the flight is the same starfield the pilot was already looking at and nothing tells him he is
 * moving at all. The tunnel is that signal: a corridor of rings running away along the ship's own
 * axis and coming at him, so motion is legible from a single glance out of the cockpit. Which way
 * the rings travel is the whole point and not a detail: a corridor that recedes says, just as
 * clearly, that the ship is going backwards.
 *
 * <p><b>Why rings rather than a solid tube.</b> A filled cylinder would have to argue with the
 * ship's hull for the same pixels in third person, and it would hide it. Open rings sit around the
 * hull instead of in front of it, cost a few hundred line vertices a frame, and need no texture.
 *
 * <p><b>The axis is the SHIP's, not the camera's.</b> Taking it from the view would swing the whole
 * corridor with the mouse, which reads as the world turning rather than the ship travelling. It is
 * taken from the entity the pilot is riding, whose rotation {@link EntityDummy} glues to the ship's
 * attitude every tick — and interpolated across the frame, so it sweeps with the camera when the
 * ship turns instead of stepping at the tick rate. A crew member on his feet rides nothing, so for
 * him the same attitude is read off the ship he is standing on; see {@link #shipHeading}.
 *
 * <p>Drawn inside the sky renderer, so the camera is already at the origin of this frame and the
 * depth mask is already off: the corridor is a backdrop, and the ship draws over it.

     * <p>Three sources, in order of how directly each knows the ship:</p>
     * <ol>
     *   <li><b>The seat the viewer is riding.</b> {@link EntityDummy} glues its rotation to the
     *       ship's attitude every tick, and vanilla has already copied that tick's value into
     *       {@code prev*}, so this one can be INTERPOLATED across the frame — it sweeps with the
     *       camera in a turn instead of stepping at the tick rate.</li>
     *   <li><b>The ship the viewer is standing on.</b> A crew member on his feet rides nothing, so
     *       the same attitude is asked of the physics integration directly, by containment. It has
     *       no previous-frame value to interpolate against; a ship parked in its transit lane is not
     *       turning, so there is nothing for the interpolation to smooth.</li>
     *   <li><b>The viewer's own look.</b> Last resort only, for a body in hyperspace that is aboard
     *       no ship at all. It swings the corridor with the mouse, which reads as the world turning
     *       rather than the ship travelling — which is why it is never used while a ship can be
     *       found, and why anyone in that state is about to be taken by the void anyway.</li>
