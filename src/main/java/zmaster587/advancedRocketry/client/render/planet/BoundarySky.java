/**
 * Slot-world sky renderer for a settled tier-2 ship: draws a billboard for every nearby system body
 * the server has synced for THIS slot dimension.
 *
 * <p><b>There is no fixed horizon band here, and there must not be one.</b> This renderer used to
 * draw a "descent boundary ring" at a constant radius in the CAMERA's frame — a band the viewpoint
 * could never leave, identical at ten blocks from a planet and at ten million, with no coupling to
 * the descent radius it was named after. It asserted "a descent boundary is here" in every cell,
 * including cells with nothing to descend to. A boundary belongs to a BODY: it is drawn around the
 * body's own bearing, at the angle that body's shell actually subtends.</p>
 *
 * <p>The body data comes from {@link PacketSystemBodiesSync#bodiesForDim(int)} (the shared
 * server-&gt;client render channel), keyed on {@code world.provider.getDimension()}. Bodies flagged
 * {@link PacketSystemBodiesSync.RenderBody#descendTarget} are highlighted so the pilot can see which
 * body the ship will descend into once inside its proximity radius.</p>
 *
 * <p>This provider replaces the ENTIRE sky rather than adding to one, so whatever is not drawn here is
 * not drawn at all -- hence the starfield alongside the billboards.</p>
 *
 * <p>Everything emitted here is wound to face the camera and drawn with vanilla's back-face culling
 * left on, matching {@link RenderPlanetarySky}. That is a hard requirement, not a style choice: the sky
 * pass runs immediately after {@code EntityRenderer.renderWorldPass} enables {@code GL_CULL_FACE} with
 * {@code GL_BACK}, so a primitive wound the other way is silently discarded and the pilot sees an empty
 * sky with no error anywhere. The static geometry is baked into display lists in the constructor -- it
 * is never rebuilt per frame.
 * Body billboards are cheap (a handful of quads) and are streamed inline, exactly as
 * {@link RenderSpaceSky} streams its planet quads.</p>
