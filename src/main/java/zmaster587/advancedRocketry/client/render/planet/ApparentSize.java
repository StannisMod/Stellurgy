/**
 * How big a fed body is drawn in the cell sky, given how far away it is <b>and how big it is</b>.
 *
 * <p>The rule is one sentence: <b>strictly increasing in the body's angular size, clamped at both
 * ends.</b> All three parts are contract, not polish.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the argument is a RATIO and not a distance.</b> Until 2026-08-16 this took a distance
 * alone, so every body at the same range drew the same disc: a moon and a gas giant beside each other
 * were indistinguishable, and the only cue a sky gave was "near" versus "far". The honest quantity is
 * the angle a body subtends, {@code r/d} — that is what makes a giant outdraw a moon at the same
 * range and what makes flying closer grow a world.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the compression stays.</b> The fed range runs from a few thousand blocks (a moon in the
 * observer's own cell) to ~10<sup>9</sup> (the far side of a system's neighbourhood), and radii span
 * from a small moon to a star, so an unclamped inverse law draws the star at a fraction of a pixel and
 * the near body across the whole sky. The renderer also drops a body whose direction vector is shorter
 * than 10<sup>-6</sup>, i.e. a body vanishes exactly when it is closest — a maximum is what stops that
 * being the only cue. So the ratio replaces the distance as the thing being compressed; it does not
 * replace the compression. An unclamped angular size is <i>correct</i> and <i>unreadable</i>, and this
 * renderer chose readable once, on purpose, with the reason written down.</p>
 *
 * <p>The mapping is logarithmic because the range spans many decades. Which function it is, and the
 * four numbers below, are {@code tunable} — what is contract is that it RISES with {@code r/d} and
 * cannot leave {@code [MIN_HALF_SIZE, MAX_HALF_SIZE]}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Pure arithmetic — no GL, no client state — so the rule can be checked without a client.</p>
