/**
 * The local crew member's look, held in the DECK frame while his movement is resolved aboard a
 * ship.
 *
 * <p>Vanilla stores one look - world yaw/pitch - and every consumer reads it: the mouse turns it,
 * {@code getLook()} ray-traces by it, {@code CPacketPlayer} replicates it, the renderer faces the
 * body by it. On a rolled deck that single world aim is the wrong frame for exactly two of those
 * consumers: the MOUSE (the player moves it relative to the screen, which is levelled to the deck)
 * and the intuitive AIM (a heading "along the deck" is a rotating world direction). Patching each
 * consumer separately - rotating the mouse delta by the camera roll - approximates the feel but
 * leaves the aim world-frame, and the roll estimate it depends on flips discontinuously when the
 * deck goes vertical, because "level the horizon with the deck" is degenerate there.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class inverts the storage instead: while aboard, the SOURCE look is a deck-frame
 * yaw/pitch pair. The mouse turns it directly - deck-relative by construction, at any attitude,
 * with no singularity. The player's world {@code rotationYaw}/{@code rotationPitch} are then
 * DERIVED from it through the ship attitude every tick and every frame
 * ({@code world = shipAttitude * deckLook}), so every world consumer - {@code getLook()}, block
 * interaction, the yaw/pitch on the wire, the rendered body, the server - keeps its exact vanilla
 * semantics and never sees a deck-frame number. The camera composes the SAME two rotations
 * ({@code RocketEventHandler}), so the crosshair and the rendered view are one transform by
 * construction. Nothing changes server-side, and the wire meaning of the player's rotation stays
 * world-frame.</p>
 *
 * <p>The one seam: something else may legitimately write the world rotation while aboard - a
 * server teleport / PosLook packet (also how test harnesses aim the player). Overwriting that from
 * the held deck look would undo it, so every sync compares the fields against what this class last
 * wrote: a mismatch means an external writer, and the deck look RE-SEEDS from the new world aim
 * (the same discipline the movement capture applies to external position writes).</p>
