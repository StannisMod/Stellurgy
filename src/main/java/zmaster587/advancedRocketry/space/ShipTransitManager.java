/**
 * The transit state machine for tier-2 ships. A ship jumping between bubble
 * cells is never frozen for the whole trip: it is <b>parked in a shared hyperspace world</b> (a live,
 * ticking bubble) while {@link ShipTransit} advances its {@link GalacticCoord} <i>logically</i>, and it
 * makes exactly <b>two momentary pack/paste crossings</b> - depart (origin cell &rarr; hyperspace) and
 * arrive (hyperspace &rarr; target cell). Passengers walk the whole transit; only the two crossings are
 * sub-second freezes.
 *
 * <p>This class owns the wiring - the per-ship lifecycle, the hyperspace lane allocation, the transit
 * integration, and the <b>refcount handoff</b> from the origin cell to the target - but not the world
 * operations. The actual VS crossing + park/unpark goes through the injected {@link Crosser} seam (the
 * production impl calls {@code VSIntegration}; tests substitute a recording fake), so the state machine
 * is exercised deterministically without a live server or VS.</p>
 *
 * <p>Refcount handoff: a ship in a bubble holds one occupant refcount on its cell. On <b>depart</b> the
 * ship leaves the origin cell &rarr; {@link SpaceManager#dematerialize}. On <b>arrive</b> it enters the
 * target cell &rarr; {@link SpaceManager#materialize}. The shared hyperspace world is a permanent
 * singleton (not pool-managed), so it holds no cell refcount - only a hyperspace lane. Server main
 * thread only.</p>
