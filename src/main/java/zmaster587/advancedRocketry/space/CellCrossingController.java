/**
 * Moves a settled ship from one cell into another in a SINGLE crossing.
 *
 * <p>Two things ask for that, and they differ only in how the destination is chosen:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A seam carry</b> — the ship flew out through its cell's face, and the neighbour it left
 *       through is where it belongs ({@link #requestCarry}). Before this existed, a ship past its cell
 *       face was neither stopped nor carried: its pose kept going while the ledger report SATURATED at
 *       the boundary, so the ship was in one place and named in another. Everything keyed on the name
 *       then answered about the wrong cell — it could not descend (the named cell holds no bodies), its
 *       jumps were refused, and the cell it was really in lost the ledger's garbage-collection
 *       protection.</li>
 *   <li><b>A short jump</b> — the drive was fired at a destination the ship reaches in less time than
 *       the flight would take to present itself ({@link #requestDirectJump}). Routing that through
 *       hyperspace is pure overhead: two crossings and a park for a flight that is over before it
 *       starts. {@link ShipTransitManager} owns the decision; this owns the move.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The arithmetic of the seam — when a pose counts as having left, and where in the neighbour the
 * ship belongs — is {@link CellSeam}'s, and has no Minecraft in it. What lives here is the world half:
 * acquiring the destination cell, capturing the crew, driving the shared {@link ShipCrossingService},
 * and the refcount handoff.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The handoff order, and why it is not the other one</h3>
 *
 * <p>The destination is materialized <b>before</b> the source is released. The reverse order leaves a
 * window in which the ship holds no cell at all, and a garbage collection landing in that window
 * collects the very cell the ship is being pasted into. The cost of this order is that a refused
 * crossing must hand the destination back, which is what the failure paths below do.</p>
 *
 * <p>A refusal is a normal outcome, not an error: the pool can be full. A refused seam carry keeps
 * flying with its report saturated at the boundary — the old behaviour, now the fallback rather than
 * the rule — and is retried after a cooldown. A refused jump is reported to its caller, which has
 * already charged the pilot for the attempt.</p>
