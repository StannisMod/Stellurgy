    /**
     * Persist the space clock and the ship ledger on the overworld save cadence (autosave +
     * shutdown both fire this on dim 0). Three steps, in this order and for this reason: stage the
     * CLOCK (always — it is read by code that does not know or care whether space registered, see
     * {@link SpaceSubsystem#onServerStarted()}), stage the FLEET (only while the subsystem is up,
     * and all-or-nothing), then write out whatever was staged in a {@code finally} — so a fleet
     * step that refuses or fails still cannot take the clock down with it.
     *
     * <p>The snapshot is written out EXPLICITLY at the end rather than merely marked dirty. This
     * looks redundant and is not: the world's save routine writes its map storage and only then
     * posts the save event, so anything dirtied from inside this handler has already missed that
     * pass. On an autosave that would just make the stored ledger one cycle stale — but the
     * shutdown save is the last one there is, and nothing writes map storage after it, so the
     * final state of every ship would be silently dropped on a clean server stop. For a subsystem
     * whose entire purpose is surviving a restart, that is the one save that must not be lost.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Nothing here may destroy, and nothing recoverable may escape.</b> This handler once ran
     * as a sequence of destructive steps — empty the stored ships, refill them, then go and fetch
     * the in-flight ones — and a failure between two of those steps left the store holding an empty
     * fleet, which the next flush made permanent. It also took the server down with it, because a
     * throw out of a dim-0 save event aborts the loop over the remaining worlds (that loop catches
     * only its own world exceptions) and then the tick loop itself. So the whole body is gathered
     * first and applied in one step that cannot half-run, and a failure it can carry on past is
     * logged rather than propagated: a save point that fails must cost one stale cycle, never a
     * fleet and never the server.</p>

     * <p><b>Why it is not bundled with the fleet, which is where it started.</b> Bundling looks
     * right: the clock dates what the fleet stores, so a pass that keeps an older fleet should
     * keep the older clock. But the fleet is not the only thing this clock dates. A jump
     * capacitor's {@code since} lives in TILE NBT and a memory crystal's {@code observedTick}

     * chunks are written, then the save event is posted. A clock left behind on a refused or
     * failed pass therefore comes back EARLIER than stamps already on disk, and the elapsed time
     * they are measured against goes negative: every capacitor in the world reads frozen at its
     * last level, with the pilot unable to jump and nothing in the log tying it to a save.
     *
     * <p>Written forward instead, the worst case is a clock at most one save cycle AHEAD of a
     * stale fleet: a cell looks a cycle older and a jump lands a cycle sooner. A clock that runs
     * backwards breaks arithmetic; a clock that runs a little ahead of one stale snapshot does
     * not. So the clock is monotonic and the fleet is atomic, and they are written separately
