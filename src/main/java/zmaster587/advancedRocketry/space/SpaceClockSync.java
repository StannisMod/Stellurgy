/**
 * The client's copy of the space clock.
 *
 * <p>The space clock is the SERVER's counter — the space subsystem's own, advanced once per server
 * tick and persisted with the subsystem's saved state. A client has no access to it and no way to
 * derive it: the only counters it is told about are its worlds' own total times, and Advanced
 * Rocketry gives every non-overworld dimension a clock that only advances while that dimension
 * ticks. So a client asking "what time is it, for the space subsystem" through any world it can see
 * gets an answer that belongs to a different clock — which is precisely the defect this class
 * exists to make unnecessary. Since the server's counter stopped being any world's, that is no
 * longer even approximately recoverable client-side; this class is the only route.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Baseline plus local advance, not a packet per tick.</b> The clock is monotonic at a fixed
 * rate, so the whole of it is one number plus elapsed ticks: a sync sets the baseline, and every
 * client tick after it adds one. Re-syncs are periodic and exist only to bound the drift between
 * the client's tick rate and a server that is running behind.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Drift budget.</b> A moon travels about half a block per tick, and the descent trigger is
 * hundreds of blocks wide, so hundreds of ticks of drift are harmless here. A re-sync MAY correct
 * the value BACKWARDS — the server's counter is the truth and a client that ran ahead is simply
 * wrong. Nothing may assume this value never decreases.</p>
 *
 * <p>Before the first sync ever arrives the answer is {@code 0}, which is what a client-side read of
 * the space clock returned before this class existed; {@link #hasSync()} distinguishes "not told
 * yet" from "told it is tick zero".</p>
 *
 * <p>Plain state, no Minecraft types: it is written by a packet on the client and advanced by a
 * client tick, but it must load on a dedicated server like any other common class.</p>
