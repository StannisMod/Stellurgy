/**
 * Server-side producer for the nebula half of the cell sky: turns the clouds seated around a cell into
 * the DIRECTIONS and apparent SIZES a client draws.
 *
 * <p>A cloud is the only landmark the universe layer has. A star cluster is invisible from outside it —
 * it can be identified only by counting stars, which no player will ever do — and a cloud is the thing
 * that makes a region recognisable at a glance, from a long way off. That is what this feed is for.</p>
 *
 * <h3>A direction, never a position</h3>
 * <p>A cloud is light years across and hundreds of light years away, so it does not move on the sky when
 * a ship crosses a cell: a cell is about 4·10⁻⁴ light years. Its bearing is therefore computed from the
 * CELL and not from a ship inside it, unlike the bodies beside it, and nothing here is a place that can
 * be flown to — a nebula has no cell name by design (attribution reads names, not matter).</p>
 *
 * <h3>What is dropped, and it is not silent</h3>
 * <p>Two bounds, both LOD and both stated: a cloud smaller than {@link #MIN_ANGULAR_RADIUS} on the sky
 * is a smudge and is left out, and at most {@link #MAX_PER_CELL} are sent, largest first. The cap
 * drops the SMALLEST, so what is lost is always what would have been least visible — but a caller that
 * needs to know how much was dropped can compare against {@link #countAround}.</p>
