/**
 * The generalized per-ship <b>crossing</b> shared by the entry on-ramp ({@link ShipEntryController},
 * planet&rarr;cell) and the planet descent ({@link DescentController}, cell&rarr;planet). It owns the
 * momentary crossing (pin the destination, run the per-ship pack/paste) and the asynchronous
 * multi-tick <b>settle</b> (rigid-teleport the re-assembled ship to its final pose, then re-seat the
 * crew AT that pose, then unpark). The settle order is a hard invariant: the pose teleport runs
 * BEFORE the re-seat, so a rider is never mounted onto a mount that is about to move — re-seating
 * first once left a freshly-mounted pilot at the paste band while his mount teleported to the cell
 * pose, a split the client can never recover from (the new mount spawns out of tracking range, so
 * the client is never told it exists and un-seats when the old mount's destroy packet lands). The
 * DIRECTION-specific decisions — where the ship goes, the ledger/refcount bookkeeping, the
 * player-facing messages — stay in each controller and are delivered here through {@link Ops}
 * (the world seam) and a {@link Completion} callback.
 *
 * <p>{@link ShipTransitManager} keeps the hyperspace legs (it advances a coordinate logically rather
 * than crossing a boundary); this service is for a boundary crossing that physically moves a ship's
 * blocks from one world into another. World-touching operations go through {@link Ops} (production:
 * {@code VSShipCrossingOps}) so the state machine is testable without VS. Server main thread only.</p>
