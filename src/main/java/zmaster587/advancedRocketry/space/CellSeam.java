/**
 * The cell face, read as something a ship can FLY THROUGH.
 *
 * <p>A cell's local range is finite, so a ship under sustained thrust reaches its face. Two answers
 * were possible: stop it, or carry it. This class holds the second one's arithmetic — when a pose
 * has left its cell far enough to count, and where the ship belongs in the neighbour it entered.
 * Nothing here touches Minecraft, a world or a ledger; that is {@link CellCrossingController}'s work.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why a margin exists at all</h3>
 *
 * <p>A face is a mathematical plane, and a ship loitering ON one would otherwise re-decide its cell
 * every tick, ping-ponging between two worlds and paying a full cut-and-paste each time. So the
 * crossing arms only once the pose is {@link #CARRY_MARGIN} PAST the face, and the ship is placed
 * {@link #REENTRY_DEPTH} inside the neighbour rather than on its face — with
 * {@code REENTRY_DEPTH > CARRY_MARGIN}, so coming back costs
 * {@code REENTRY_DEPTH + CARRY_MARGIN} of deliberate travel and cannot happen by drift.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Both are FRACTIONS of the cell, never absolutes</h3>
 *
 * <p>An absolute margin silently encodes an assumed speed and an assumed cell size: change either and
 * a number chosen for "about two seconds" quietly becomes two minutes or two ticks. Derived from
 * {@link GalacticCoord#HALF_CELL} they move with the cell, and the property they were chosen for —
 * a duration — survives.</p>
