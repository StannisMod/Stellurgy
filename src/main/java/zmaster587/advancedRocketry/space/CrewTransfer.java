/**
 * Moves a tier-2 ship's crew across a per-ship crossing. {@link VSIntegration#crossShip} moves
 * blocks + tile NBT only — riders differ per caller — and a crossing re-assembles the ship into a
 * <b>fresh subspace</b>, so every absolute-subspace binding (a pilot dummy's {@code seatPos})
 * goes stale. This class owns the two halves around the crossing:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #capture}: BEFORE the cut — enumerate the crew at the ship's live world position
 *       (riders live in the WORLD frame, never in the shipyard box), record each of them against a
 *       binding that IS invariant under re-assembly, and retire the old dummies (their seat blocks
 *       are about to stop existing).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #reseat}: AFTER re-assembly — re-establish each of them on the rebuilt ship and
 *       transfer them into the destination world.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Both postures of being aboard</h2>
 *
 * A crew member is carried in whatever posture he is in; SEATED and STANDING are two shapes of one
 * membership, not two populations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>SEATED</b> — a pilot on a linked pilot seat. Recorded by his seat's AFC-link offset and
 *       re-mounted at the far end on a freshly-bound dummy (the {@code BlockPilotSeat} mount
 *       recipe).</li>
 *   <li><b>STANDING</b> — a crew member on his feet on the deck. Recorded by the deck point he
 *       stands on relative to the same flight computer, and placed back at that point on the far
 *       side, HELD there until his ship exists: the re-assembly is asynchronous, and a body handed
 *       to world gravity meanwhile falls off (or through) a deck that is not there yet.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The two are recorded against the same landmark for the same reason — the flight computer is
 * what survives a ship being rebuilt into a fresh subspace.</p>
 *
 * <p>Server main thread only.</p>
