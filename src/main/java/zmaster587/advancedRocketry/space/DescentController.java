/**
 * The tier-2 <b>planet descent</b>: how a ship in space drops onto a planet — the inverse of the
 * {@link ShipEntryController} ascent on-ramp. Descent is by PROXIMITY: the flight computer's tick
 * detects that a SETTLED slot-world ship whose pilot is flying has closed within
 * {@link ShipEntryController#DESCENT_RADIUS_BLOCKS} of a descend-target body's POI and calls
 * {@link #requestDescent}; this controller then:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>guards that the ship is genuinely in space (a SETTLED ledger entry — the INVERSE of entry's
 *       "not already in space" guard);</li>
 *   <li>resolves the arrival in the target planet dimension through the injected
 *       {@link PasteResolver} — the ship arrives HIGH IN THE AIR and the pilot flies it down, so no
 *       ground fit is attempted and only an unresolvable destination is REFUSED;</li>
 *   <li>hands the momentary crossing + async settle to the shared {@link ShipCrossingService}, then,
 *       once the ship is physically cut from its space cell, releases that cell (dirty + dematerialize)
 *       and drops the ledger entry — the ship has left the subsystem;</li>
 *   <li>on settle, the crew is told they arrived; the pilot flies down from the landing height.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>World-touching operations go through the shared {@link ShipCrossingService.Ops} seam
 * (production: {@code VSShipCrossingOps}) and the {@link PasteResolver} (production:
 * {@code VSDescentPasteResolver}) so the state machine is testable without VS. Server main thread
 * only. Ascent (entry) and descent hold their own {@link ShipCrossingService} instances.</p>
