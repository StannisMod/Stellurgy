 * A fixed pool of pre-registered empty-space worlds ("slots") that are rebound to different

 * storage mechanism for the movable-ship space subsystem.
 *
 * <p>Mechanism: a slot's chunk directory is derived from its provider's
 * {@link WorldProviderSpaceSlot#getSaveFolder()}, which this pool points at the BOUND CELL's
 * folder. Rebinding a slot to a new cell = flush + unload the world, then re-init it against the
 * new cell (MC's {@code AnvilSaveHandler} rebuilds the chunk loader from the new
 * {@code getSaveFolder()}; Valkyrien Skies' own per-world save serialises / restores its ships).
 * {@link DimensionManager#unloadWorld(int)} only QUEUES the unload (processed at the end of the
 * server tick), so a rebind is done as {@link #unload(int)} then, a tick later, {@link #load(int,
 * String)} — the caller (test) provides the tick gap.</p>
