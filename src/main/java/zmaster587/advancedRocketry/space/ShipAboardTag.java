/**
 * The per-player durable record "<i>I am aboard tier-2 ship X, at Y</i>", stored in the player's
 * persistent ForgeData compound so it survives a logout and a server restart.
 *
 * <p><b>Aboard is not the same as seated.</b> Y is a seat for a crew member in one and a deck point
 * for a crew member on his feet; both are aboard, and the record carries whichever applies. Reading
 * "no seat" as "not aboard" is what used to send anyone who stood up in orbit to an ordinary spawn.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> Nothing else can answer "which ship was this player aboard" once the
 * server has been restarted. {@link ShipLedger} is keyed by SHIP id and carries no crew and no
 * reverse index, so it cannot be searched player-first; the in-memory crew stash a crossing builds
 * ({@link CrewTransfer.Crew}) lives only for the duration of that crossing and is gone with the JVM;
 * and the ship's own blocks may not even be materialized at the moment the player logs in. This tag
 * is therefore the ONLY player&rarr;ship binding that crosses a restart boundary, and the login
 * restore path reads it before the player is placed into any world.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the offset triple.</b> A seat is recorded by its flight-computer link OFFSET
 * ({@code afcDx/afcDy/afcDz} = the linked computer's position minus the seat's), never by an
 * absolute position. Every re-assembly of a ship rebuilds it into a FRESH subspace, so absolute
 * subspace coordinates go stale on any jump, entry or descent, while the relative offset is
 * invariant under the rigid relocation. It is the same identity {@link CrewTransfer} matches seats
 * by after a crossing, which is what lets a restored player be put back in the seat he left.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the coordinate is only a diagnostic, and why it may be absent.</b> The galactic
 * coordinate stamped here is the ship's position at the moment the record was written. It may be
 * stale by the time he logs back in (the ship can keep flying under another crew member), so the
 * ledger's coordinate wins wherever the two disagree; this one is kept for logging and cross-checks.
 * It is also OPTIONAL: a ship parked on a planet is in no cell at all, and a crew member aboard it
 * still needs the ship-relative half of this record to be put back on its deck after a relog. A
 * record with no coordinate therefore means "aboard, nowhere in particular" — it says nothing about
 * which dimension the player belongs in, and the dimension decision must not consult it.</p>
 *
 * <p>The NBT half ({@link #write}, {@link #read}, {@link #clear(NBTTagCompound)}) touches no world,
 * server or player type, so it is exercisable against a bare compound. The player-facing wrappers
 * are thin shims over {@code getEntityData()}. Server-side in practice.</p>
