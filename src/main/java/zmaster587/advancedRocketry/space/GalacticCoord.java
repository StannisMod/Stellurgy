 * Absolute galactic position as a <b>sectorized fixed-point</b> coordinate - the exact-integer
 * absolute frame for the movable-ship space subsystem. Decoupled from (and NOT to be confused with)
 * the legacy {@code SpacePosition}, which is the {@code double} solar-map render coordinate.
 *
 * <p>Each axis is a {@code long sector} index plus a local block offset, with
 * {@code absolute = sector * CELL + local}. Integer arithmetic gives uniform precision at any
 * magnitude and does not drift when a position is integrated over a long automatic transit - unlike
 * a {@code double}, whose spacing grows with magnitude (~220&nbsp;km per ULP at galactic scale).</p>
 *
 * <p>The sector grid <i>is</i> the bubble grid: a cell is one {@link #CELL}-block cube, so two
 * positions with equal sector triples share a cell (and, once loaded, the same world). The local
 * offset is kept canonical in {@code [-HALF_CELL, HALF_CELL)}, i.e. within &plusmn;16M blocks of the
 * cell centre. Cell-centre content is at local {@code (0,0,0)}.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The sector triple is a cell NAME, not a place.</b> A cell rides the body it belongs
 * to, so {@code absolute = sector * CELL + local} is the STATIC-frame reading — true for a void cell
 * and for the sector arithmetic that keeps names apart, and false the moment either endpoint's frame
 * has moved. Hence {@link #staticFrameDistanceTo}'s spelling, and hence {@link AbsolutePos}, which is
 * what "where this is, at tick t" is expressed in.</p>
 *
 * <p>Immutable value type. Proximity within one cell is computed on the (small, near) local delta cast
 * to {@code double} via {@link #staticFrameDistanceSqTo(GalacticCoord)} - precise because the delta
 * between nearby positions is small even though the absolute magnitudes are huge.</p>

     * sub-block position round trip, each against an origin control in the same run. The wall that
