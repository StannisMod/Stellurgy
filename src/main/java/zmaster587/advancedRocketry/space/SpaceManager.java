/**
 * Server-side controller for the movable-ship space subsystem: it resolves absolute
 * {@link GalacticCoord}s to logical cells, keeps a fixed pool of physical slot worlds bound to the
 * hottest cells (refcount + lazy LRU eviction), and garbage-collects the on-disk cell store.
 *
 * <p>Two tiers, decoupled:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Slot pool</b> - the {@link SlotBinder#slotDims() N} pre-registered worlds that actually
 *       tick. A cell is <i>materialized</i> by binding it to a slot; only materialized cells are
 *       live. N is the direct performance knob.</li>
 *   <li><b>Cell store</b> - a sparse, coord-keyed on-disk record of <i>modified</i> cells only. A
 *       clean (never-diverged, regenerable) cell is discarded on eviction; a dirty one is flushed to
 *       the store and kept until GC removes it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class holds only the pure bookkeeping and policy; every world-touching action goes through
 * the injected {@link SlotBinder}. Time (for last-visit / GC age) comes from the injected
 * {@link LongSupplier} clock (server tick count in production). Single-threaded: all methods run on
 * the server main thread.</p>
