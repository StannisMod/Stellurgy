/**
 * The <b>one writer</b> of a player's durable aboard record ({@link ShipAboardTag}).
 *
 * <h2>Why exactly one</h2>
 *
 * There used to be two independent durable records of "this player is aboard a ship", written by
 * two subsystems with no stated authority between them, and a third half-writer clearing one of
 * them on every dismount. That is what sent a crew member who stood up in orbit to an ordinary
 * spawn: one record said "not aboard" because he had left his seat, while the other still knew
 * exactly where on the deck he was standing. Everything that changes the record now goes through
 * {@link #reconcile}, so there is one derivation to be right or wrong about.
 *
 * <h2>Derived from state, not from transitions</h2>
 *
 * The record is computed from where the player IS — seated on a ship's seat, or resolved on its
 * deck — rather than accumulated from mount/dismount events. A transition-driven record misses
 * every route nobody hooked: the pilot who sits down on the planet and flies up crossed into space
 * without any event firing in a cell, and was then a player in orbit with no evidence that he was
 * aboard anything. Deriving it also makes the writer idempotent and self-healing: a record that
 * went stale while the ship moved under another pilot is corrected on the next pass.
 *
 * <h2>Cadence</h2>
 *
 * Refreshed at most once a second, plus at logout — the event that immediately precedes the save
 * whose data a login reads back. (Forge fires the logout event before the player file is written;
 * a world save, by contrast, writes player data BEFORE any world-save hook runs, so there is no
 * usable pre-write hook there and the one-second bound is what covers a crash.) In between, a
 * record can be up to a second stale in memory, which nothing observes: the only readers are the
 * login restore and the deck hold, and both run after a save.
 *
 * <p>Both triggers deliberately run OUTSIDE the world's entity tick — the end-of-server-tick pass
 * and the logout event. The clear below has to look a ship up over the world's tile entities, and
 * that list is not safe to walk from inside the tick that mutates it. Nothing calls in from a
 * movement path for the same reason.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Clearing needs positive evidence</h2>
 *
 * "Not aboard right now" is not enough to drop a record: a crossing lifts its crew out of their
 * seats for as long as it takes to cut, move and rebuild the ship, and during that window every
 * seat and every deck honestly answers "he is not on me". Silence from an absent ship is not
 * evidence about the player. The record is therefore dropped only when the ship it names is
 * present in the player's world and he is demonstrably not aboard it.
 *
 * <p>Server main thread only; every method is a safe no-op off the server side.</p>
