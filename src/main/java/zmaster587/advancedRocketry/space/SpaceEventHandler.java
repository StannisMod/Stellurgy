/**
 * Server-side event wiring for the movable-ship space subsystem: putting a returning player back
 * where he left off, and noticing when a space cell's content diverges from what can be regenerated.
 *
 * <h2>Why a login needs special handling at all</h2>
 *
 * Minecraft restores a player by the dimension id stored in his save file. That is meaningless here:
 * slot dimensions are a transient POOL. Their ids are minted in registration order at every server
 * start, and a given slot holds whichever cell was most recently bound to it — so the slot a player
 * logged out in may, on the next boot, be a different star system entirely, or nothing at all. What
 * survives a restart is his ship's identity and the ledger's record of where that ship is.
 *
 * <h2>Two phases, and why the first one is not merely defensive</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Placement</b>, at player-file load — the only hook that runs after the save file has been
 *       read but BEFORE the world is chosen for him. It rewrites the stale slot dimension to the
 *       dimension he actually belongs in. Doing the real resolution HERE, rather than parking him
 *       somewhere neutral and teleporting afterwards, is what stops a player who logged out in orbit
 *       from materialising on a planet for a moment first: by the time the world is chosen it is
 *       already the right one, so the client is never sent anywhere else.</li>
 *   <li><b>Seating</b>, once he is in the world — mounting him back on his seat. This cannot happen
 *       in phase one because a ship re-assembles asynchronously; its seat blocks may not exist yet
 *       on the tick he logs in, so the seating retries for a few ticks. Only a crew member who was
 *       SEATED is re-seated: one who was on his feet is put back on his deck point by the deck
 *       hold, which also has to pin him against world gravity while his client re-captures.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Phase one only ever intervenes for a player whose saved dimension is one of the subsystem's own
 * worlds. A player saved in an ordinary world is left strictly alone — vanilla's own restore is
 * correct for him, and the least this code can do is not touch it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because phase one can land a player in a slot dimension on his very first world-join packet,
 * the client has to know that dimension exists BEFORE it arrives. That is why the slot-dim sync is
 * also sent on the raw connection event, ahead of the player being spawned — the same pre-spawn
 * channel this mod already uses to teach a client about its planet dimensions.</p>
 *
 * <p>Server main thread only.</p>
