/**
 * A position in absolute galactic space <b>at one stated moment</b>.
 *
 * <p>This is deliberately NOT a {@link GalacticCoord}. A {@code GalacticCoord} is a cell NAME plus an
 * offset inside that cell's frame, and a cell's frame moves: its origin is the position of the body
 * the cell belongs to. So "where this thing is, absolutely, at tick t" is a different kind of value
 * from "which cell it is in and where inside it", and the two must not share a type &mdash; not for
 * tidiness, but because {@link GalacticCoord#ofSectorLocal} <i>carries</i> an out-of-range offset into
 * the sector triple. Expressing a frame-displaced position as a {@code GalacticCoord} would therefore
 * silently RENAME the cell the moment the frame origin drifts more than half a cell from the cell's
 * own grid position, which is a routine amount of orbital travel.</p>
 *
 * <p>An absolute position is only ever an intermediate: it exists to be subtracted from another one at
 * the same tick, giving a {@link BlockDelta} &mdash; a direction and a true distance. Nothing is stored
 * as one and nothing is addressed by one: what goes on disk is always a cell name plus an in-cell
 * offset, never a value whose meaning depends on the tick it happened to be written at.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why it is sectorised, and not three block counts</h3>
 *
 * <p>It used to hold three raw block {@code long}s. A sector index reaches 9.2&middot;10<sup>18</sup>,
 * while {@code sector * CELL} overflows a {@code long} at 2.9&middot;10<sup>11</sup> &mdash; so the
 * coordinate system could NAME positions this type could not express, over seven orders of magnitude,
 * silently and with no error. Nothing caught it because nothing had yet been placed far enough out.
 * Holding a sector triple and an in-cell offset removes the ceiling entirely: the whole addressable
 * range is expressible, and a distance is computed from the two deltas rather than from a product
 * that cannot fit.</p>
 *
 * <p>Immutable value type.</p>
