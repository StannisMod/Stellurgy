/**
 * The tier-2 <b>entry on-ramp</b>: how a ship first enters space. Entry is ASCENT — a pilot climbs
 * past the launch dimension's {@code getOrbitHeight()} ceiling — a phase distinct from the
 * hyperjump; ascent is the SAFE exit, not the only one. The flight computer's tick detects the
 * crossing and calls {@link #requestEntry}; this controller then:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>resolves the launch planet's galactic address through the universe registry (its OWN zone
 *       cell), falling back to the configured home-system anchor;</li>
 *   <li>places the ship on a spawn RING outside the descent radius — the hysteresis contract with
 *       the descent trigger, so an entry can never immediately re-descend;</li>
 *   <li>materializes the cell (an exhausted pool REFUSES entry — the ship simply stays below the
 *       ceiling), then hands the momentary crossing + async settle to the shared
 *       {@link ShipCrossingService};</li>
 *   <li>on settle, rigid-teleports the pose to the honest-3D realization of the entry coordinate
 *       (world Y &asymp; local Y + HALF_CELL + band) and settles the ship in the {@link ShipLedger}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Crossing + re-assembly are asynchronous, so the settle runs over several ticks with retries
 * inside {@link ShipCrossingService}. World-touching operations go through the shared
 * {@link ShipCrossingService.Ops} seam (production: {@code VSShipCrossingOps}) so the state machine
 * is testable without VS. Server main thread only.</p>
