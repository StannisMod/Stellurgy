/**
 * Leaving your ship in hyperspace kills you.
 *
 * <p>Hyperspace is not a place with a floor. It is an all-air void world whose only content is the
 * ships parked in it, 2048 blocks apart, so nothing a crew member could step onto is ever within
 * reach — stepping off the hull means falling through nothing for as long as the flight lasts. The
 * ship is the only place to be, and this is what makes that true rather than merely likely.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing prevents him from trying.</b> There is no wall and no refusal at the deck edge: the
 * danger is the mechanic. A crew member is free to walk, to look over the side, and to fall off it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why this is a countdown and not an instant</h3>
 *
 * "Aboard" is answered by the deck resolver, and that answer is legitimately absent for a while
 * around a crossing: the ship is re-assembled asynchronously at the far end, the departure boarding
 * retries per tick until a seat resolves, and a player carried between worlds spends a moment in a
 * world whose ship has not caught up with him. Killing on the first tick that reads "not aboard"
 * would kill for the instrument's silence rather than for the player's position — the exact shape
 * this codebase has been bitten by before.
 *
 * <p>So the check is a consecutive-tick counter, and its budget is not a fresh magic number: it is
 * the SAME budget the boarding and re-seat retries already spend before they give up
 * ({@code MAX_ARRIVAL_ATTEMPTS} / {@code MAX_SEAT_ATTEMPTS} = 200 ticks). A player who is not aboard
 * anything for longer than the machinery is still willing to try to put him aboard is not waiting on
 * a crossing; he is in the void. Any shorter budget would race a slow arrival, and a slow arrival is
 * exactly the case a rare hang would produce.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What counts as aboard</h3>
 *
 * Either shape of membership: riding a seat's dummy, or resolved on a deck by
 * {@link ShipFrameTravel#aboardShipId}. Those are the two postures the whole subsystem recognises,
 * and this class deliberately asks the same question the aboard record asks rather than inventing a
 * second geometry that could disagree with it.
 *
 * <h3>The suit does not save him</h3>
 *
 * The damage bypasses armour, so a space suit is no protection. A suit answers vacuum, and every
 * player who reaches hyperspace is wearing one — exempting them would leave this rule with no
 * population to apply to. Hyperspace is not thin air; there is nothing out there to be equipped for.
 *
 * <p>Server main thread only.</p>
