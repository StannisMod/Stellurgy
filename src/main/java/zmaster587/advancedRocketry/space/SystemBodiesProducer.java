/**
 * Server-side producer for the {@link PacketSystemBodiesSync} render channel: turns the set of
 * MATERIALIZED CELLS into the per-slot-dim list of bodies the client draws in the slot-world sky
 * ({@code BoundarySky}). Each body is carried as a DIRECTION from the observer point in that cell,
 * measured through both cells' frames at the broadcast tick (see {@link #buildByDim}). Sent to a
 * player at login and rebroadcast on a throttle so the boundary/bodies track a ship as it flies
 * within the cell — and so the SYSTEM moves around it while it sits still.
 *
 * <p><b>The sky shows the SYSTEM, not the cell.</b> A pilot parked in interplanetary void still sees
 * his star and his system's planets; what he sees of each is where it is right now relative to him.
 * The feed is the system's bodies UNIONED with whatever is keyed at the observer's
 * own cell — the union is not tidiness, since the system read answers empty for a cell no anchor
 * attributes and aggregates POIs of body cells only, so a straight swap would erase an orbital
 * station standing in the observer's own void cell.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The sky belongs to the cell, not to a ship.</b> The feed is keyed off the cell&rarr;slot
 * bindings ({@link SpaceManager#loadedCells}) and never off a ship's lifecycle state. A world that is
 * a live cell has that cell's surroundings in its sky for everyone in it: a pilot whose ship is
 * mid-jump, a passenger, a crew member who walked off the hull, or someone left behind by a ship that
 * departed. Deriving the feed from settled ships instead made all of those skies blank &mdash; and the
 * blank was indistinguishable from an empty cell.</p>
 *
 * <p>No discovery / {@code isSystemKnown} gate (by design, presence is the gate). Each player is sent
 * ONLY the dimension he is in: see {@link #broadcastTo}. Server main thread only.</p>
