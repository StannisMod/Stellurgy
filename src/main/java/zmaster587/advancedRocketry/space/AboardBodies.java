/**
 * Carries the bodies aboard a ship that are NOT its crew — a mob on the deck, a dropped item, a
 * minecart — across a crossing, by the same ship-relative point the crew is carried by.
 *
 * <h2>Why these are stowed rather than held</h2>
 *
 * A crew member's movement is client-authoritative, so a crossing has to negotiate with his client:
 * it places him and then pins him until that client takes the deck capture over. Nothing here is
 * negotiating with anyone. The server owns these bodies outright, so the honest treatment is the one
 * the ship's own blocks get — write them down, take them out of the world, and put them back on the
 * far side. That also removes the window a held body would have to survive: there is no moment in
 * which one of these is standing in a world whose ship has not been rebuilt yet, so there is nothing
 * for gravity to do to it.
 *
 * <h2>What counts as aboard</h2>
 *
 * The ship's own stay region, in its subspace — the same volume the hyperspace void judges a crew
 * member by, so a mob and a player standing side by side on a deck are aboard by one definition
 * rather than two. A body whose position cannot be mapped into that frame is not aboard anything and
 * is left exactly where it is.
 *
 * <p>Server main thread only; a safe no-op when the physics mod is absent or the ship is not loaded.</p>
