/**
 * Production {@link DescentController.PasteResolver}: works out where a descending ship arrives in a
 * real planet dimension.
 *
 * <p>A descent does <b>not</b> look for a landing site on the ground. The ship materializes HIGH IN
 * THE AIR over the destination and the pilot flies it down himself — he may never need to touch the
 * surface at all. That removes the whole "does the ship fit above the terrain here" question: there
 * is no terrain query, no footprint fit, and therefore no way for a descent to be refused because a
 * particular column was occupied.</p>
 *
 * <p>The arrival is a two-part move, exactly as the entry on-ramp does it in reverse: a VS ship's
 * BLOCKS live in its subspace shipyard and must be pasted inside the vanilla block band, while its
 * POSE is an ordinary world-frame value that is not capped by the build height. So the blocks go
 * into a legal band just under {@link TerrainHeightFinder#MAX_BUILD_Y} (lane-strided across the
 * destination's spawn column, so simultaneous descents cannot overlap), and the settle
 * rigid-teleports the re-assembled ship's pose — carrying its riders — up to
 * {@link #arrivalAltitude}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Safe {@code null} (refuse the descent) only when a world is missing, VS cannot find the ship, or
 * the ship is literally taller than the world's block band.</p>

     * <p>The upper bound is deliberately the ENTRY line rather than the raw physics clamp. The two
     * are not interchangeable here: the space subsystem raises the physics clamp to cover the whole
     * realized cell pose band (megablocks up) at server start, so "the clamp minus a hundred" is
     * millions of blocks above a planet — unreachable by any pilot, and far above the altitude at
     * which the entry on-ramp would immediately take the ship back off the planet. Deriving from the
