/**
 * The movable-ship space subsystem's STATE OBJECT: the six services are its fields, wired by its one
 * constructor, and they live and die together. They used to be six separate mutable statics on this
 * class — a shape that let a test seam replace them with no way back, and let each probe wire a
 * different subset of what production wires.
 *
 * <p><b>It does not own its own lifetime, and deliberately cannot.</b> This class has a public
 * constructor, so it is not a singleton and no {@code static current} of it could ever mean anything.
 * Its owner is the mod object, {@link AdvancedRocketry}: that holds the server's instance in a field,
 * drives the lifecycle steps below by handing them that field, and is the one route to it
 * ({@link AdvancedRocketry#spaceSubsystem()}). The steps stay here because they are space's business,
 * but each one now TAKES the subsystem it acts on instead of looking one up.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is exactly ONE accessor, and it answers with the whole stack. The six per-service statics
 * this class used to publish ({@code space()}, {@code ledger()}, {@code transit()}, …) are gone
 * deliberately: with two instances alive — one built by a fixture, one held by the mod — which one a
 * caller reached depended on WHICH ACCESSOR it happened to use, and nothing could ask whose subsystem
 * it had. Callers now read the services off one object, so a swap landing between two reads can no
 * longer hand out half of each stack.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Forge subscriptions that drive it live beside it in {@link SpaceSubsystemEvents}, which is a
 * class of static handlers reaching into this object rather than an object pretending to be a
 * handler.</p>
 *
 * <p>GC cadence (maintainer-ratified): a periodic tick sweep ({@link #GC_TICK_INTERVAL}) plus a
 * pool-pressure trigger. A single WARN fires only when the pool is saturated and a live bubble slot is
 * force-evicted (the real overload signal); tier-2 store GC over idle cells stays quiet.</p>
 *
 * <p>Server main thread only.</p>
