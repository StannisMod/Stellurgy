/**
 * Pure-Java arcade physics for {@link RocketFlightMode#FREE_FLIGHT}.
 *
 * Deliberately depends on NO Minecraft types — every input is a primitive
 * and every output is captured in {@link Step}. This is the entire decision
 * surface for FF kinematics, so it can be unit-tested deterministically
 * without booting a server.
 *
 * <p>Units follow EntityRocket's convention: motionX/Y/Z are block-deltas per
 * tick. Gravity is a per-tick velocity decrement (positive value drains
 * motionY).
 *
 * <p><b>Thrust authority.</b> The class does not invent a thrust scale of its
 * own. The caller passes {@code thrustMag} — the <em>gross per-tick thrust
 * acceleration</em> (blocks/tick²) derived from the rocket's classic stats
 * (thrust-to-weight, config-aware). EntityRocket computes it as
 * {@code StatsRocket.getAcceleration(g) + gravity}, so at full vertical throttle
 * the net (thrust − gravity) equals the classic ascent acceleration and the FF
 * climb gate is exactly the classic thrust-to-weight gate (TWR &gt; 1). See
 * {@code EntityRocket.tickFreeFlight}.
 *
 * <p><b>Fuel.</b> This class does NOT account fuel — that lives in
 * EntityRocket so it mirrors the classic burn (getFuelConsumptionRate, the
 * {@code rocketRequireFuel} config flag, bipropellant oxidizer). The pure layer
 * only reports, via {@link Step#thrustApplied}, whether thrust was applied this
 * tick; the caller drains fuel when it was. Whether thrust is permitted at all
 * is passed in as {@code canThrust} (fuel present, or fuel not required).
 *
 * <p><b>Two control laws</b>:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #faStep} — Flight Assist ON (default): the pilot edits a
 *       body-frame <em>velocity setpoint</em> (see {@link #rampSetpoint});
 *       FA computes the thrust that tracks it, cancelling gravity. Zero
 *       setpoint = hover.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #step} — Flight Assist OFF: raw Newtonian, and now literally so.
 *       Translation channels are direct thrust while held; release = coast under
 *       gravity. The manual brake (Shift) lives here only. <b>There is no ceiling on
 *       speed</b> — only on acceleration ({@link #MAX_THRUST_ACCEL}), so you go as fast as
 *       you are willing to burn for and must burn as long again to stop.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Where a speed bound is genuinely needed it belongs to the ENVIRONMENT rather than to the
 * craft, and it is not imposed here: a vanilla entity's own movement resolves collision against
 * the SWEPT box it is about to traverse ({@code Entity.move}), so a rocket cannot pass through
 * terrain however fast it goes, and empty space has nothing to hit at all.</p>
 *
 * <p>Player intent enters via a {@link FreeFlightInput} normalised to [-1, +1].
