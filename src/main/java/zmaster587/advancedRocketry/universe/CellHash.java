/**
 * The one mixer every procedural answer about a cell is drawn from.
 *
 * <p>A splitmix-style mix of the world seed, an integer coordinate triple and a per-field salt, uniform
 * over 64 bits. Distinct salts are what keep the independent draws — blob mask, occupancy, star type,
 * body count, a planet's radius — from correlating with each other.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>This arithmetic is a save-compatibility surface for the LIFE of a world, not an implementation
 * detail.</b> Every unpinned procedural system is re-derived from it on every query, so changing a
 * constant here silently moves stars and reshapes planets in every existing save that has not been
 * touched. It lives in one place for exactly that reason: two copies of a mixer are two things to
 * forget about.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Public because it belongs to every SCHEMA, not to one generator.</b> A released world model is
 * kept reproducible forever, and a later version that changes what it draws still has to draw it out of
 * the same mixer — a second copy of this arithmetic in another package would be a second thing to keep
 * in step, which is exactly what the paragraph above forbids.</p>
