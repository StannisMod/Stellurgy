/**
 * One galaxy: a seated object with a centre, a type, a size, an orientation and a density profile.
 *
 * <p>It is a VALUE, produced on demand from {@code (seed, galaxy cell)} and stored nowhere — exactly
 * as a {@link PlanetarySystem} is. Nothing here is persisted and no coordinate carries a galaxy index; the
 * index is {@code sector / galaxySpacing}, a derived grouping of the sector space that already
 * exists (see {@link GalaxyField#galaxyIndex}).</p>
 *
 * <h3>What a galaxy is FOR</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>It draws the star field.</b> A super-cell hosts a system with a probability scaled by
 *       {@link #densityAt} at that point, so the disc, the bulge and the arms place the stars
 *       instead of an independent per-cell coin toss.</li>
 *   <li><b>It is the frame a bound thing rides.</b> Inside the declared {@link #radiusLy radius} a
 *       position co-rotates at {@link #angularSpeedAt}; outside it, it does not.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The inside/outside test is the DECLARED RADIUS, never a level of the profile.</b> A profile is
 * continuous and has no boundary, so a frame decided by "is the density high enough here" would flip
 * back and forth for anything hovering near the threshold. The radius is a sphere: the disc and its
 * halo are both inside it, which is right — a halo is bound to its galaxy too.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Rotation</h3>
 * <p>{@code θ(t) = θ₀ + ω(r)·t}, analytic in {@code t} and never integrated, so nothing accumulates
 * drift — the argument {@link BodyEphemeris} already makes one level down. The curve is
 * {@code v(r) = v∞ · r / √(r² + r_core²)}: solid-body near the centre, flat outside the core, and the
 * type's {@link GalaxyGenConfig.GalaxyType#coreRadiusFraction} says where the turnover is, so a dwarf
 * rotates almost rigidly (little shear) and a massive spiral shears strongly. Hence
 * {@code ω(r) = v∞ / √(r² + r_core²)}, which is finite at the centre rather than singular.</p>
 *
 * <p>The rate is slow enough to be invisible inside one save, which is the ratified position: the
 * mechanic exists even when slow, and the speed is tuning.</p>
