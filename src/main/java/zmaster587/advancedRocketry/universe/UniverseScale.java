/**
 * How big the universe layer's furniture is, in one place: how far apart stars stand, how much room a
 * system is allowed to occupy, and how those two turn into cells.
 *
 * <p>Every number here is stated as a PHYSICAL length and converted, never written as a cell count.
 * A cell count is a reading of {@link GalacticCoord#CELL}, and that constant may move; a light year
 * may not. Stating the physics and deriving the cells is what keeps the star field looking the same
 * after the cell edge is retuned.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The two lengths, and why they are separate</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Star separation</b> — the edge of the cube that holds at most one system. It decides how
 *       far a flight between two stars is, and nothing else.</li>
 *   <li><b>The separation floor</b> — the guaranteed clear space around a system. It decides how much
 *       room a system's bodies have and how close two unrelated systems may ever be seen to stand.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>One level up, the same pair says how big a galaxy is and how far apart galaxies stand — see the
 * galaxy-lattice section below. It is the same scheme applied twice, which is the point: a system is
 * seated in a cube, and so is the galaxy that holds it.</p>
 *
 * <p>These used to be one number: a system's extent was <i>defined</i> as a fraction of the
 * interstellar step, which truncated systems at a few AU, filled half the gap to the next star with
 * one system's neighbourhood, and forced the orbit scale to shrink to compensate. Separating them is
 * what lets a system be as big as its outermost orbit while the sky still reads as a sky.</p>
 *
 * <p>A near-pair of lattice seats is NOT a binary — it is two unrelated systems with two names, two
 * frames and no gravitational relation between them. The floor is therefore set comfortably wider
 * than any binary the model describes, so multiplicity is something the generator states inside ONE
 * system rather than something the lattice fakes by accident.</p>
