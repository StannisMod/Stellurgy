 * Turns a pointing into addresses a ship can navigate by.
 *
 * <p>This is the discovery instrument, so it asks the registry what is THERE rather than what is
 * already known: an instrument that only reported what the player had already found could never find
 * anything.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Two stages, because they are two different questions and only one of them is expensive.</b></p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Detection</b> ({@link #detect}) — is anything in this direction, and is it bright enough
 *       to register? An anchor lookup and a magnitude, both O(1), with no bodies built and no
 *       retinue derived. This is what a survey spends its looks on.</li>
 *   <li><b>Characterisation</b> ({@link #characterise}) — what IS it? The system's bodies, one
 *       address each. Paid only where the first stage found something.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>They used to be one call, so the cheap question could never be asked without paying for the
 * expensive one. {@link InfoTier} already distinguished the two grades of knowledge; what was missing
 * was an instrument that could hold one without the other.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What a look sees is bounded by BRIGHTNESS, never by distance.</b> A star registers when its
 * apparent magnitude from the observatory — its own luminosity, dimmed by distance and by whatever
 * dust lies between — is above the aperture's limit. So the same instrument reaches a blue giant
 * eighty times farther than a red dwarf, and a starless world it never reaches at all: a rogue
 * planet emits nothing, and finding one is a thing you do by going there.</p>
 *
 * <p>What a cell yields once characterised is its system's <b>bodies</b>, one address each, at the
 * coarsest detail an observation can carry. That grade is not a formality — it is what the navigation
 * console reads to decide which of a body's fields it may show, and at telescope grade that is
 * already the whole global set: name, mass, stellar class, rings, sky colour, topology, atmosphere
 * and its density, temperature, water.</p>
