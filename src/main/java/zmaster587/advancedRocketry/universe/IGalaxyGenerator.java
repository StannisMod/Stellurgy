 * The addon-replaceable galaxy-generation seam (universe-model.md &sect;3). Given the world seed and an
 * absolute {@link GalacticCoord}, it answers "is there a procedural system here, and what" plus a region
 * enumeration used as the telescope-scan backend.
 *
 * <p>Both methods MUST be a pure, deterministic function of {@code (seed, coord)} — the same arguments
 * always yield the same system — so a scan and a later jump agree, and a re-materialised cell regenerates
 * identically. The registry supplies the RAW world seed (it does not pre-mix per cell), leaving the mixing
 * policy to the generator so a clustered sampler can correlate neighbouring cells.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface is defined here (the Layer-1 universe package) but only a trivial default —
 * {@link EmptyGalaxyGenerator} — ships with it. The real clustered sampler and its {@code <galaxyGen>} XML
 * parameters are a follow-up; an addon installs its own via {@link UniverseRegistry#setGenerator}.</p>
