/**
 * The Layer-1 universe registry (universe-model.md &sect;2): the single owner of galactic PLACEMENT.
 *
 * <p>It answers only "what exists and where" — no worlds are loaded. It is an <b>additive bridge</b> over the
 * legacy star catalogue: {@link StellarBody} + {@link DimensionManager}'s int-keyed star list keep their
 * identity and persistence untouched; this registry INDEXES them, attaching a {@link GalacticCoord} to each
 * system and answering coord&harr;system both ways. Systems therefore stay LOCATION-AGNOSTIC — the coordinate
 * lives here, never on the star.</p>
 *
 * <p>Placement is keyed by the ANCHOR cell (one system per anchor; every coord snaps to its
 * {@link GalacticCoord#cellCentre() cell centre} before use). Per amendment A#1a a system is an anchored
 * NEIGHBOURHOOD: the star holds the anchor cell, every planet/belt its own cell — a MEMBER cell attributes
 * back to its system via {@link #anchorForCell} (super-cell partition; derive-don't-store). The persistent
 * override store holds authored (XML anchor) placements, player POIs and {@code pin-on-touch} snapshots of
 * touched procedural systems; untouched procedural space is re-derived on demand from {@code (seed, coord)}
 * through the {@link IGalaxyGenerator} seam (which ships as {@link EmptyGalaxyGenerator} here).</p>
 *
 * <p>A {@link WorldSavedData} on the overworld's global {@code MapStorage} (reachable from any dimension since
 * the overworld is always loaded). Server-side only; the world seed is re-derived on load rather than
 * persisted (it is immutable for a save and is the single source of truth).</p>
