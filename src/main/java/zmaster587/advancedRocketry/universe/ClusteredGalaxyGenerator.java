/**
 * A deterministic, addon-default {@link IGalaxyGenerator} producing a CLUSTERED procedural galaxy
 * (universe-model.md &sect;3): dense galaxies separated by inter-galaxy void, so a bounded scan/reach range is
 * a natural horizon.
 *
 * <p>Every answer is a pure function of {@code (seed, cell)} — no state, no RNG — so a scan and a later jump
 * agree and a re-materialised cell regenerates identically. The scheme, all O(1) per query:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link GalaxyField} seats the GALAXIES — one per {@link GalaxyGenConfig#galaxySpacing}-cube, each
 *       with a centre, a type, a radius, an orientation and a density profile;</li>
 *   <li>partition space into {@link GalaxyGenConfig#minSpacing}-cube <i>super-cells</i> — at most one system
 *       each (the minimum-spacing guarantee);</li>
 *   <li>a super-cell hosts a system with probability {@link GalaxyGenConfig#density} <i>scaled by the
 *       owning galaxy's profile at that point</i>, seated at a hash-chosen cell within the super-cell.
 *       Outside every galaxy the profile is zero, so the intergalactic void is what the profile leaves
 *       empty rather than a second rule.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The galaxy tier replaces an independent per-blob Bernoulli mask. Drawn per cell above the
 * site-percolation threshold, that mask produced one unbounded sponge rather than galaxies: no centre,
 * no radius, no orientation, and no answer to which galaxy a point was in.</p>
 *
 * <p>A procedural system is one or more stars (type and size sampled by weight from the seed) with
 * <b>synthetic negative ids</b> — never in the catalogue and never a dimension, so an id cannot collide
 * with a real star id ({@code 0..N}) or a dim id. About half of systems hold a companion, and a
 * companion is a star in its own right: it has its own id, its own orbit about the primary, and its own
 * cell, so a world can be bound to it and every world here is lit by all of them.</p>
