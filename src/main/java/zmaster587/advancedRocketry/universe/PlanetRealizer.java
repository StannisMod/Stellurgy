/**
 * The seam where a scanned dot becomes a world: turning a procedural {@link SystemBody} into a real
 * dimension a ship can put down on.
 *
 * <p>Without this the procedural galaxy is look-but-do-not-touch. Every body the generator places
 * carries {@link Constants#INVALID_PLANET}, and {@code isDescendTarget()} is false for all of them, so a
 * system full of planets has nowhere to land.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The four rules this class exists to keep</h3>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>A DESCENT realizes, and nothing else does.</b> Scanning is cheap, remote and repeatable, and
 *       the tier schema answers a scan from the derivation on purpose — so minting on a scan would let
 *       one telescope sweep allocate dimensions by the dozen. Moons obey the same rule on their own
 *       account rather than being realized eagerly with a parent.</li>
 *   <li><b>Realization MATERIALIZES what was already derived; it never rolls fresh values.</b> Mass,
 *       atmosphere, temperature and water are promised to a telescope from across the system, so a
 *       landing that disagreed with the scan would make the whole tier schema a lie. This is why
 *       {@code generateRandom} cannot be reused here: it walks a shared {@code Random}, allocates an id
 *       immediately, and seeds a biome roll from {@code System.nanoTime()} — none of which can answer
 *       the same question twice.</li>
 *   <li><b>After realization the SAVE is authoritative.</b> The body is pinned, the dimension is
 *       registered and its properties are written down; a later seed, config, XML or modset change must
 *       not move or reshape a planet somebody has stood on.</li>
 *   <li><b>A realized planet is never un-realized.</b> There is no eviction path here on purpose. A long
 *       game accumulates dimensions in proportion to the planets a player has actually LANDED on, which
 *       is bounded by play rather than by the size of the galaxy — and rule 1 is what keeps that bound
 *       tight.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Server main thread only.</p>
