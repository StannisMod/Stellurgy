/**
 * A nebula: the diffuse cloud a star cluster is wrapped in.
 *
 * <p><b>It is not seated separately, and that is the design.</b> A molecular cloud, the young cluster
 * that condenses out of it and the ancient cluster that has blown it away are ONE object at three
 * ages — so a nebula is derived from a {@link StarCluster} and its type's residual gas, and there is
 * no second lattice, no second spacing number and no way for a cloud and its cluster to disagree
 * about where they are.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What it is for today, and what it is a seam for</h3>
 * <p>Today a cluster is a pure refinement of the star lattice: it has no property anything outside it
 * can observe, so it can only be discovered by counting stars. A nebula is what makes a cluster a
 * LANDMARK rather than a statistical fact.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #densityAt} is the whole seam.</b> Every consequence a nebula could ever have — a
 * sensor it muffles, a drag it imposes, something it conceals, something a ship mines out of it — is a
 * function of how thick it is at a point. That function exists now and is tested; what does NOT exist
 * is any consumer of it, deliberately: none of those numbers is ratified, and inventing them
 * alongside the thing they judge is how a mechanic ends up measuring itself.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Diffuse matter is NOT a body</h3>
 * <p>A nebula has no cell name, is not a destination, and does not participate in one-real-body-per-
 * cell. It is the same category as a system's comet cloud: <i>attribution reads names, not matter</i>,
 * so a nebula may freely overlap whatever it lies across.</p>
 *
 * <p>Immutable value type.</p>
