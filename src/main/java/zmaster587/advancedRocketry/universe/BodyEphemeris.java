 * A body's ORBITAL LAW, frozen as elements rather than as a position.
 *
 * <p>This is what makes a cell able to ride its body: given a tick, it answers where the body stands
 * relative to whatever it orbits, in blocks. It is the same law
 * {@code DimensionProperties.orbitThetaAt} + {@code positionFor} apply, lifted out of the dimension
 * object so that a body which no longer has one &mdash; a PINNED procedural system, a POI &mdash;
 * still moves.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>A pin freezes the ELEMENTS, never the positions.</b> Snapshotting a system's positions would
 * stop that system dead the first time a player built a station in it, because pin-on-touch fires on
 * the first {@code addPoi}. Elements cost the same four numbers and keep the system alive.</p>
 *
 * <p>Immutable value type; NBT round-trips as a flat sub-compound.</p>
