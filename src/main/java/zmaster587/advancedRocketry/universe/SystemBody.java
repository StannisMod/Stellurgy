/**
 * One addressable object inside a star system (universe-model.md &sect;4): a star, planet, moon, or a POI
 * (asteroid belt, station slot). It is pure DATA — its walkable realization is Layer 2 (the ship branch),
 * never here.
 *
 * <p><b>A body has a NAME and a PLACE, and they are not the same number.</b> The name is the
 * {@link #name() sector triple} of its cell: an identifier, fixed for the life of the save, which is
 * what a coordinate a player wrote down keeps denoting. The place is a function of world time and
 * comes in two readings:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #inCellOffsetAt(long)} — where the body stands inside its own cell's frame. Zero for
 *       the cell's PRIMARY by construction (the primary is what the frame is centred on); LIVE for a
 *       moon, which shares its parent's cell name and orbits inside it.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #absoluteAt(long)} — the frame origin at that tick plus the offset. Only ever an
 *       intermediate for a distance or a direction; nothing is stored as one, because a stored
 *       coordinate may not mean something different from the tick it was written at.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@link #addressAt(long)} packages the first reading as a {@link GalacticCoord} — name plus
 * in-cell offset, which is the canonical stored form and the right input to anything that works
 * INSIDE one cell (a placement ring, the descent trigger, an entry coordinate). It is deliberately
 * not an absolute: two of those can only be compared at the same tick and through both frames.</p>
 *
 * <p>A {@link SystemBodyKind#PLANET planet}/{@link SystemBodyKind#MOON moon} carries the {@code dimId} of its
 * {@code DimensionProperties} — the dimension a descent drops into; other kinds carry
 * {@link Constants#INVALID_PLANET}. {@code starId} is the owning system (negative for a procedural system).</p>
