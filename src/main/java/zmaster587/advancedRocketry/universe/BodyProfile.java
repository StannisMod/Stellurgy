/**
 * Everything a procedural body IS, derived from {@code (seed, cell)} alone — the object that crosses
 * the universe&rarr;dimension layer boundary.
 *
 * <p>The UNIVERSE layer produces one of these ({@link PlanetDerivation}); the DIMENSION layer consumes
 * it when a body is realized into a real world. Nothing here is a world, a block, a biome or a
 * dimension id: a profile can be computed for a body nobody has ever visited, which is precisely what
 * lets a telescope report a world's mass, atmosphere and temperature from across the system while the
 * player still has no suit for it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Determinism is the contract, not an optimisation.</b> The scan and the landing must describe
 * the same world, so realization MATERIALIZES this profile rather than rolling fresh values. Terrain is
 * the one field a scan does not promise from afar ({@code TERRAIN_TYPE} sits at the approach tier), and
 * it is still derived here so that everything about a body has exactly one origin.</p>
 *
 * <p>Immutable value object.</p>
