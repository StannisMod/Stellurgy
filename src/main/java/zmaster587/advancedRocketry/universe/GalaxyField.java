/**
 * Where the galaxies are: the lattice one level above the star lattice, and the same scheme.
 *
 * <p>Space is partitioned into {@code galaxySpacing}-cube <b>galaxy cells</b>; a cell holds at most
 * one galaxy, seated at a hash offset inside it, with every parameter — type, radius, orientation,
 * arms — drawn from {@code hash(seed, gx, gy, gz)}. Nothing is stored. A galaxy is a value produced
 * by this class exactly as a system is produced by {@link ClusteredGalaxyGenerator}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The galaxy index is DERIVED, not an addressing tier</h3>
 * <p>{@link #galaxyIndex} is {@code sector / galaxySpacing} — a coarse reading of the sector space
 * that already exists. No coordinate gains a field, nothing is persisted, and a distance is still a
 * distance. That is what makes "which galaxy is this?" an O(1) question with an answer, where an
 * independent per-cell mask left it undefined.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Every point is in a galaxy CELL; only some are in a GALAXY</h3>
 * <p>There is no "nowhere". A cell either holds a galaxy or is entirely void, and inside a cell that
 * holds one, a point is inside a galaxy iff it is within some declared radius. Those are different
 * questions with different methods here — {@link #galaxyOwning} names the cube's PRIMARY,
 * {@link Galaxy#containsSector} says whether you are in one named galaxy, and
 * {@link #galaxyContainingSector} answers which of the cube's galaxies you are actually in.</p>
 *
 * <h3>A cube holds a primary AND its retinue</h3>
 * <p>The lattice seats one galaxy per cube 25 diameters wide, so on the lattice alone the nearest
 * galaxy is always 25 diameters off — which is the distance to the nearest equal GIANT, not to the
 * nearest galaxy of any kind. A real giant keeps company at one to three diameters. So a galaxy draws
 * {@link #satellitesOf satellites} as CHILDREN inside its own cube, the way a system draws moons inside
 * its primary's cell. <b>Nothing about the representation moves</b>: the cube keeps its size, no
 * coordinate gains a field, and a satellite is a {@link Galaxy} value drawn from {@code (seed, cell,
 * ordinal)} and stored nowhere. What moves is only that a cube's galaxies now have to be told apart —
 * hence {@link Galaxy#satelliteIndex()} and the {@code -S<i>n</i>} suffix in its name.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The home galaxy</h3>
 * <p>Galaxy cell {@code (0,0,0)} is RESERVED: it always holds a galaxy, seated so that the universe
 * ORIGIN falls at a sun-like radius inside its disc, and drawn only among types large enough to hold
 * authored content. A galaxy is otherwise a hash draw and may simply not be there under another seed —
 * but authored content must exist under EVERY seed, and a hand-picked absolute coordinate would
 * otherwise land in intergalactic space with probability 99.997 %.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Around the origin, not ON it.</b> The centre of a galaxy is its nucleus, which is the last
 * address a shipped solar system should have. Only the galaxy's EXISTENCE and the origin's place
 * inside it are fixed; its type, size, orientation and arms are drawn like any other galaxy's, so
 * every world's home galaxy is still its own.</p>
