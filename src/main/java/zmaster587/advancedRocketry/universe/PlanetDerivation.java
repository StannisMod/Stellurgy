/**
 * Where a procedural body's PHYSICS comes from, and therefore where its TYPE comes from.
 *
 * <p>A pure function of {@code (seed, cell, body index)}: no world, no {@code Random}, no registry, no
 * tick. Ask it twice and it answers the same, which is the whole point — a telescope reports a world
 * from across the system, and the landing has to match what the telescope said.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The order, and why it is this order</h3>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Metallicity</b> — one more seeded property of the star beside temperature and size. A
 *       metal-poor star formed a metal-poor disk, which is what makes the ore profile physical rather
 *       than tabulated.</li>
 *   <li><b>Orbital radius</b>, drawn LOGARITHMICALLY: real systems are spaced roughly geometrically, and
 *       the range is anchored on the star's own {@linkplain #referenceDistance reference distance}, so
 *       zoning follows the star instead of a fixed table. A cool dwarf gets a compact system and a hot
 *       giant a sprawling one, for free.</li>
 *   <li><b>Bare temperature</b> at that radius, with NO atmosphere. The snow line is this temperature
 *       crossing a threshold — never a separate parameter.</li>
 *   <li><b>Radius and mass</b>, correlated with the zone: small rock inside, giants past the snow line.
 *       Gravity is DERIVED from them ({@code g = M/R²}); it is not drawn.</li>
 *   <li><b>Pressure</b>, from the world's ability to hold an atmosphere against its own heat — heavy and
 *       cold retains, light and hot does not.</li>
 *   <li><b>Temperature again</b>, now with that atmosphere. The greenhouse term needs a pressure, and
 *       the pressure needed a temperature; one pass each way resolves it without iterating, and the bare
 *       reading is kept for the zoning decisions that must not depend on the atmosphere.</li>
 *   <li><b>Type</b> = a weighted draw among the presets that admit the resulting point. Zoning
 *       therefore EMERGES from the physics; no preset is placed anywhere by hand.</li>
 *   <li><b>Terrain</b> from that type's weighted list, and finally the <b>oxygen</b> roll — biology on
 *       top of an already-suitable world, never a consequence of it.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Every constant below is a balance knob. None is a contract, and the class deliberately exposes the
 * intermediate steps so a test can pin the RELATIONS (colder past the snow line, heavier holds more air)
 * without pinning any of the numbers.</p>
