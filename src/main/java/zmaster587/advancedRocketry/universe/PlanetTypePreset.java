/**
 * A <b>planet type</b>: the named region of physical parameter space a world can land in, together with
 * everything that follows from being that kind of world.
 *
 * <p>There is no second "subtype" concept — a type IS this preset. One language: it declares the
 * property ranges that admit a world, the weighted list of ways its terrain may be generated, its ore
 * table and its native biome palette. Advanced Rocketry ships a stock set ({@link PlanetTypes}); a pack
 * overrides them or adds its own, and a genuinely new class of world needs no code.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>This object straddles the layer boundary on purpose, and the two halves are read by different
 * layers.</b> The UNIVERSE layer (a pure {@code (seed, cell)} derivation) reads only the numeric
 * admission ranges, {@link #weight()}, {@link #gasGiant()}, {@link #allowsOxygen()} and the
 * {@link #terrain()} weights — none of which touch a world, a registry or a block. The DIMENSION layer
 * reads {@link #biomeIds()}, {@link #oreProperties()}, {@link #seaLevel()} and {@link #oceanBlock()}
 * when it materializes a body into a real dimension. Nothing in the first list may be made to depend on
 * the second, or the derivation stops being answerable from afar — which is the whole reason a scan can
 * describe a world before anyone has been there.</p>
 *
 * <p>Immutable; built through {@link #builder(String)}.</p>
