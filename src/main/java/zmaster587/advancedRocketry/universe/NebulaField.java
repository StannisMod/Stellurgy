/**
 * Where the nebulae are — which is: wherever a star cluster still has gas.
 *
 * <p>There is no nebula lattice and no nebula spacing. A cloud is derived from the cluster it wraps
 * and that cluster's residual gas, so the two can never disagree about where they are, and adding
 * nebulae cost the generator no new partition, no new occupancy draw and no new number to invent.
 * A cloud with no stars in it is expressible too — it is a cluster type whose subdivision is 1.</p>
 *
 * <h3>This class is a SEAM, and it has no consumer yet</h3>
 * <p>What a nebula DOES to a ship that flies into it — muffled sensors, drag, concealment, something
 * to mine — is deliberately not here. None of those numbers is ratified, and building a mechanic
 * beside the criteria that would judge it is how a mechanic comes to measure itself. What is here is
 * everything such a mechanic would need: where the clouds are, how big they are, and
 * {@link Nebula#densityAt} for how thick one is at a point.</p>
