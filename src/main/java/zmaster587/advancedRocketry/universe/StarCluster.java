/**
 * One star cluster: a region of a galaxy where the star lattice is FINER by an integer factor.
 *
 * <p>The stratified lattice one level up reads correctly as randomness but produces no GROUPS, and
 * groups are what a real sky has: a lattice caps density at about three times the mean, while an open
 * cluster runs tens of times the field and a nucleus thousands. A cluster is the same seat one level
 * down, and the whole mechanism is one word — <b>commensurate</b>.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why commensurate, and why that makes it cheap</h3>
 * <p>Each coarse super-cell inside a cluster is divided into {@code k³} sub-cells, so the fine lattice
 * tiles exactly the coarse cells it replaces. There is no partial cell at the edge, no seam, and
 * nothing to re-prove per ring — which is what a graded spacing would have cost. And because
 * <b>membership is decided per COARSE cell</b>, a cell is wholly in a cluster or wholly out of it, so
 * "which lattice does this coordinate live on" stays an O(1) question with one answer.</p>
 *
 * <p>The sub-cell bounds are computed by proportioning rather than by dividing: sub-cell {@code i}
 * runs from {@code floor(i·s/k)} to {@code floor((i+1)·s/k)}. That tiles a coarse cell of ANY edge
 * exactly, including one that {@code k} does not divide — where a plain {@code s/k} would leave a
 * remainder and a seam.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The separation floor becomes a property of a LATTICE LEVEL</h3>
 * <p>Inside a globular's core stars really are closer together than a wide binary, and encounters
 * really are frequent. The 10 000 AU floor is derived from whatever spacing is in force locally, so a
 * clustered region gets a proportionally smaller one — and a system there loses outer bodies by the
 * same rule that has always applied. A floor applied outside its domain of definition is precisely the
 * mistake this design keeps removing elsewhere.</p>
 *
 * <p>Immutable value type.</p>
