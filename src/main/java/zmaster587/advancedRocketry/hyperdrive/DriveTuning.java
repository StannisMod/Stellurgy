     * count, capped at {@link #MAX_CAPACITOR_COMPONENTS}. So power spans {@code (512/7)^α} while the

     * drive's burst is roughly two hundred times a full bank, and a jump is REFUSED outright once the
     * coil count passes about 35. Raising α therefore needs the capacitor economy re-derived with it,
