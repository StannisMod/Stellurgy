/**
 * The act of jumping: what a press of the helm key does, and when it costs anything.
 *
 * <p>The two halves of the decision live in two places on purpose. Choosing a destination is
 * deliberate work at a console, with the forecast in front of you — that is where a jump is
 * <b>armed</b>. Committing to leave belongs at the helm, where the pilot can see what is around him
 * — that is where it <b>fires</b>. Neither surface can do the other's job, and that is the feature.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The order of events is fixed and the whole sequence hangs off it: the gate is free, so it runs
 * as often as anyone asks; the spool is free, so aborting inside it costs nothing; and the capacitor
 * burst is the first and only thing that is spent. Once the burst fires, a refusal is a refusal the
 * pilot has already paid for — which is why nothing that can refuse is allowed to run after it.</p>
