/**
 * One real ship's drive: which machines it actually has aboard, and what they are worth together.
 *
 * <p>Everything is resolved the way the rest of the ship layer resolves things — from the flight
 * computer outward. A machine belongs to this ship when it was assembled into it (it carries the
 * offset back to THIS computer) and it is standing inside this ship's own claim. Both halves matter:
 * the link alone would let a machine that was never assembled claim membership, and the claim alone
 * would let a second ship parked alongside lend its capacitor.</p>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is cached. A drive is asked about when a pilot presses a key, and a number that
 * was true at assembly time is a number that will eventually be a lie — a coil pulled out mid-flight
 * has to make the ship slower the moment it is pulled.</p>
