/**
 * Makes the Advanced Flight Computer tile a Valkyrien Skies force controller. VS collects a
 * ship's {@link IPhysicsBlockController} tiles (via {@code PhysicsObject.onSetTileEntity})
 * and calls {@link #onPhysicsTick} on each every physics step, ON THE PHYSICS THREAD — the
 * only place a force actually integrates into ship motion (a velocity setpoint or a
 * game-thread force are both overwritten by the solver, confirmed at runtime).
 *
 * <p>This mixin is applied ONLY when the physics mod is on the classpath (gated by
 * {@link ARMixinPlugin}); without it the interface would not resolve. So the AR tile class
 * itself never hard-references a physics-mod type — the soft dependency stays intact.</p>
 *
 * <p>Control law: a deadbeat toward the commanded world velocity, mass-cancelling so the
 * ship accelerates as commanded regardless of how heavy it is:
 * {@code force = mass · clamp((vDesired − vCurrent) / dt, authority)}. The command is read
 * from {@link TileAdvancedFlightComputer#commandedVelocity} — this tile's own, written on the
 * game thread and read here on the physics thread.</p>
