/**
 * Free Flight camera lock vs the vanilla riding echo.
 *
 * While a player rides an entity, the server answers every client position
 * report with an SPacketPlayerPosLook carrying the rotation the client sent
 * ~1 RTT earlier. With the camera hard-locked to a turning craft this echo
 * yanks the view back by (turn rate × latency) — an 6–18° per-frame hiccup.
 * After the vanilla handler has applied the packet (and queued its confirm),
 * re-pin the camera to the craft. All FF gating lives in
 * {@link KeyBindings#repinCameraAfterTeleport()}; outside Free Flight this is
 * a no-op, and the netty-thread early-return invocation is filtered there too.
