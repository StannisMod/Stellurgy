/**
 * Guards Valkyrien Skies' ship-load loop against the "already loaded" double-load crash.
 *
 * <p>VS's {@code loadAndUnloadShips} iterates {@code loadQueue} and, for each UUID, throws
 * {@code IllegalStateException("Tried loading a ShipData that was already loaded?")} if that
 * ship is already in {@code loadedShips}. AR's tier-2 assembly spawns a ship in place
 * ({@code queueShipSpawn}), which loads it immediately; if a player is standing near the pad
 * when it spawns, VS's proximity loader also queues the very same ship for a load, so next
 * physics tick the load loop finds it already loaded and crashes the whole server thread.
 * The automated client e2e dodges this by keeping its observer far during spawn — a human who
 * builds and assembles in place cannot.</p>
 *
 * <p>Fix: at the head of the load loop, drop from {@code loadQueue} every ship that is already
 * loaded. This is exactly the pre-condition VS asserts on; enforcing it before the loop turns
 * the illegal double-load into a harmless no-op, changing nothing else about VS's behaviour
 * (a ship queued for load that is genuinely not loaded still loads normally).</p>
 *
 * <p>The spawn diagnostics that used to ride along here are gone: they observed rather than
 * changed anything, so they belong to the tests and now live in a test-only mixin. What is left
 * in this class changes VS's behaviour and nothing else.</p>
 *
 * <p>Applied ONLY when Valkyrien Skies is on the classpath (gated by {@link ARMixinPlugin});
 * without it the {@code WorldServerShipManager} target would not resolve. VS's own class and
 * field names are stable across dev and reobf (they are not vanilla-MC names), so no refmap
 * translation is involved.</p>
