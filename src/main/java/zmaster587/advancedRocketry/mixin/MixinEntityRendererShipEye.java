/**
 * Puts the camera where an aboard entity's head actually is.
 *
 * <p>{@code EntityRenderer.orientCamera} ends with {@code GlStateManager.translate(0, -eyeHeight, 0)}.
 * Being the last transform pushed it is the first one a world vertex meets, so the eye is always
 * {@code entityPosition + (0, eyeHeight, 0)} - along the WORLD up, whatever the body is standing on.
 * Roll a ship past vertical and the pilot's eye moves into the deck hanging above his seat: the camera
 * is inside a solid block and nothing renders.</p>
 *
 * <p>Redirecting that one call to offset along the SHIP's up instead fixes it for the pilot and for any
 * crew member. Everything else about the camera - the third-person boom, the sleeping case, the
 * rotations - is untouched.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code require = 0}: OptiFine and other render mods rewrite {@code orientCamera}. If the call is
 * not there we silently keep vanilla's eye rather than aborting the whole (required) mixin config.</p>
