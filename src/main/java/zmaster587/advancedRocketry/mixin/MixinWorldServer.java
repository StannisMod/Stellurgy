/**
 * Makes beds bring the planet's morning. Vanilla's sleep skip in
 * {@link WorldServer#tick()} rounds the new time to the next multiple of
 * 24000, but AR planets render day/night from {@code rotationalPeriod}
 * (≈ {@code (1/gravity)^3 * 24000}, ≠ 24000 for almost every planet), so the
 * vanilla rounding lands at an arbitrary phase — usually still night
 * (issue #66).
 *
 * <p>We {@code @Redirect} the FIRST {@code setWorldTime} call in {@code tick()}
 * (ordinal 0 = the sleep-skip block; ordinal 1 is the per-tick +1 increment)
 * and, for {@link IPlanetaryProvider} dimensions, round to the dimension's
 * {@code rotationalPeriod} instead. The rounding math lives in
 * {@link ARDimensionWorldInfo#computeSleepWakeTime(long, int)} so it is unit
 * tested. Non-AR worlds keep vanilla behaviour untouched.</p>
 *
 * <p>The per-dimension clock this writes into is owned by the
 * {@link ARDimensionWorldInfo} wrapper (per-dim time, not the swallowed
 * {@code DerivedWorldInfo} no-op), so the skip actually takes effect.</p>
