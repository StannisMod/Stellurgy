/**
 * Claims {@link Entity#move} before the physics mod does, so an entity aboard a ship can have its
 * collision resolved in the ship's own frame (where the deck is axis-aligned) instead of the world
 * frame (where the entity's box is upright and the deck is not).
 *
 * <p>The physics mod injects at the same point, cancellably. Mixin emits an
 * {@code if (ci.isCancelled()) return;} guard after <em>each</em> callback at an injection point, so
 * whichever callback runs first and cancels prevents the rest — including the vanilla method body.
 * Callback order follows mixin application order, which is why this mixin declares an explicit
 * priority rather than relying on the default both configs happen to use.</p>
 *
 * <p>Inert unless armed through {@link ShipLocalMoveControl}, and then only for one entity, only on
 * the server. It references no physics-mod type, so it is safe to weave with or without that mod.</p>
