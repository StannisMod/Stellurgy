/**
 * A flight recorder for MOTION SMOOTHNESS: bounded, wall-clock-stamped rings of where a tier-2
 * ship, its pilot and the pilot's own camera actually were, sampled on each of the four clocks the
 * craft's motion passes through.
 *
 * <p><b>Why four clocks.</b> A ship the pilot describes as "flying in jerks" can be jerking on any
 * one of them, and they are fixed by different things:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #PHYS} — the physics loop's own thread, one sample per physics step. This is where
 *       the ship's velocity actually integrates, so an irregular interval here means the physics
 *       loop is not keeping its rate, and a displacement that alternates between much and nothing
 *       means the force controller is fighting something.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #GAME} — the server world tick, one sample per flight-computer tick. The command the
 *       controller chases is republished here, so a stalled server tick starves the controller of
 *       fresh commands even while the physics loop runs on perfectly.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #CLIENT_TICK} — the client's own tick, one sample per tick, carrying where the
 *       client believes the player is. The server can be perfectly smooth and this still jerk: the
 *       ship pose arrives over the wire and is smoothed by a filter.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #CLIENT_FRAME} — one sample per rendered frame, carrying the pilot's eye point. This
 *       is the only channel that sees what he actually looks at, and the only one that sees a
 *       frame-time hitch (chunk meshing, a GC pause) as what it is.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A magnitude here always ships with the components it came from, because a distance that will
 * not move cannot say WHICH axis is stuck.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Always on, deliberately.</b> The rings are allocated on first use and every sample is a
 * handful of stores into preallocated primitive arrays — no allocation, no formatting, nothing that
 * can itself perturb the timing it measures. Gating this on test mode would have made it useless in
 * the one place the symptom has ever been seen, which is a real play session: the point of a flight
 * recorder is that it was already running when the thing happened.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Thread model.</b> One ring per (channel, key), and each ring is written by exactly one
 * thread — physics thread, server thread, or client thread. Readers (a probe, a reflective harness
 * read) run on a different thread and may catch a half-written newest sample; a diagnostic can
 * afford that, and every summary below is computed over the samples BEHIND the write cursor.</p>
