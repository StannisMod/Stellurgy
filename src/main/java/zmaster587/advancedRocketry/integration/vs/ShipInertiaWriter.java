/**
 * The one place that writes a mass frame into the physics engine's own record, and the only place in
 * the mass model that holds physics-engine types.
 *
 * <h2>Why a writer and not just a provider</h2>
 *
 * <p>The engine keeps mass, centre of mass and the inertia tensor in one record that it re-reads
 * every physics tick, and it maintains that record as an <b>accumulator</b>: the paste path feeds it
 * one block at a time, a per-block hook applies deltas for the rest of the craft's life, and a world
 * load restores whatever number was serialized. The hull is never rescanned. So authoritative writes
 * are picked up for free — the incremental deltas are merely one way to produce those three numbers,
 * not a channel to fight.</p>
 *
 * <p>Writing a fresh centre of mass mid-flight is safe: the physics loop shifts the body's origin by
 * the same vector rotated into world space, so the craft does not jump when the centre moves.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Delta by default, recompute as the authority, disagreement REPORTED</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #apply} is the authority — a whole frame, computed from the hull, written as three fields
 * together. {@link #reconcile} is the instrument that says whether the cheap incremental path has
 * drifted from it, and it <b>does not correct anything</b>. That is deliberate and it is the point:
 * a reconciliation that silently substitutes the right number turns a safety net into normal
 * operation and destroys the only signal that a trigger is missing. The repair for drift is the
 * missing trigger; the report is what makes it findable. In a test build the report is a failure.</p>
 *
 * <h2>The tensor may never be singular</h2>
 *
 * <p>The physics loop inverts the tensor every tick, so a degenerate one is a NaN torque rather than
 * a rounding error — a single cube or a perfectly straight mast is enough to produce one. The frame
 * handed here is expected to be regularised already (its builder smears each contributor over its
 * own extent); this class refuses a frame whose tensor cannot be inverted rather than passing it on,
 * because a crash inside the physics tick names neither the ship nor the writer.</p>
