/**
 * Resolves one tick of an aboard living entity's movement in its SHIP's frame instead of the world's.
 *
 * <p>Minecraft moves a body on world axes: gravity is {@code -Y}, the vertical drag (0.98) differs from
 * the horizontal friction (0.91), the walking basis comes from yaw alone, "on the ground" means a
 * blocked {@code -Y} motion, and the collision box is axis-aligned by definition. Rotate the floor and
 * every one of those is wrong. Worst is the drag: the two constants give a 49x vertical and a 10x
 * horizontal terminal-velocity gain, so a deck-down pull with real world X/Z components is bent steeply
 * toward world {@code +Y} - the crew member is flung up a wall instead of settling on the deck.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ship's blocks, however, also exist unrotated and axis-aligned in the ship's own subspace. Map
 * the entity there and the deck is flat, "down" is plain {@code -Y}, and the box is deck-aligned for
 * free. Apply the ordinary rules, map the result back, and the world sees a body that stands, walks and
 * falls on a tilted floor.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ship-frame position is AUTHORITATIVE; the world position is derived from it through the ship
 * transform every tick. That single choice is what makes an entity ride a moving, rotating ship with no
 * separate "drag" step: when the transform changes, the derived world position follows. It is also
 * forced. The physics mod carries aboard entities itself, but only those it has associated with a ship
 * inside {@code Entity.move} - and an entity whose movement AR resolves never reaches that method, so
 * that carry is not available to us. Deriving the ship-frame position from the world position instead
 * would leave the body standing still in the world while the deck rotated out from under it.</p>

 * <p>The stored position is abandoned and re-seeded whenever something OTHER than this class moved the
 * entity in the world - a teleport, or the server applying a client's own movement packet.</p>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately narrow. {@link #handles} refuses water, lava, ladders, elytra, levitation, creative
 * flight and passengers; those keep world-frame semantics, and the caller must let vanilla run.
 * {@code doBlockCollisions} (cactus, cobweb, portals) is not replicated inside the deck frame.</p>

     * <p><b>Why a body needs putting back at all.</b> An aboard body's position is derived, every
     * tick, from the deck point it holds — but it is derived while the entities move, and the ships'
     * poses advance AFTER that, at the end of the same tick (the physics substrate ticks its ships
     * on {@code WorldTickEvent}/{@code ClientTickEvent} phase END, both sides). So from the moment
     * the deck moves until the body's next movement tick — which is the whole interval anything
     * else observes, the renderer included — the body stands where the deck WAS one tick ago. It is
     * not a drift: the body's deck point is re-imaged every tick and never accumulates error. It is
     * a standing lag of exactly one tick of ship motion, and under rotation it is a tangential
     * offset that grows with the body's distance from the axis: measured at 2 rad/s, a body 1.974
     * blocks off the roll axis stood 0.1974 blocks off its own deck spot on every tick of the roll,
     * and the same craft would stand a body on its rim eight times further out.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>What it costs.</b> The body renders a tick behind the deck it is standing on — its
     * render interpolation spans the tick BEFORE the one the ship's does — so a rolling craft
     * visibly slides its crew and snaps them back, twenty times a second. And the capture guard,
     * which measures how far a body has moved from the point this class committed for it, reads
     * that whole lag as displacement it must find an allowance for; on a large enough craft it
     * exceeds any allowance a still ship could justify.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Why re-seating and not a better carry.</b> A carry is a velocity, and no velocity fixes
     * this: the body's position never comes from one. It comes from the deck point mapped through a
     * transform, and the fault is that the mapping happened against the previous pose. So the
     * mapping is redone once the pose is current, and nothing is integrated across a tick boundary
     * at all.</p>
     *
     * <p>Bodies whose movement this side merely FOLLOWS are left alone ({@link #followsRemoteOwner}
     * — a real player's position is decided on his own client and arrives by packet; the server
     * re-seating its copy would argue with the packet stream, which is the war the guard's rebase
     * exists to avoid). So is a rider, whose position its vehicle owns.</p>
