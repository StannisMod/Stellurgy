/**
 * One thing that weighs something, at a point in the ship's own frame.
 *
 * <p>Everything a ship's mass is made of enters the model through this type: a hull block, the fluid
 * in a tank, the items in a chest, a crewman in a seat. Keeping them in one currency is what makes
 * the centre of mass and the inertia tensor mean anything — a model where the hull is counted in one
 * place and the cargo in another can produce a centre of mass that lies outside the ship.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Units are kilograms and metres.</b> One block is one metre, so a block of ordinary building
 * material weighs a few hundred kilograms, exactly as its density suggests. Nothing here knows about
 * gravity: mass is a property of the ship, weight is a property of where the ship happens to be, and
 * conflating the two makes a craft change character when it changes planet.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #extent} is what the mass occupies, not where it sits. It exists because a body with
 * no size has no rotational inertia of its own, and a ship assembled purely from sizeless points can
 * come out with a singular inertia tensor — a straight line of blocks being the obvious case. The
 * physics solver inverts that tensor every step, so a singular one is not an inaccuracy, it is a NaN
 * torque. Giving each contributor its true box inertia removes the failure at the source.</p>
