/**
 * What a ship weighs, where that weight sits, and how it resists being turned.
 *
 * <p>Three numbers drive every derived flight characteristic, and they are all here: the total mass
 * decides acceleration for a given thrust, the centre of mass decides what torque a thruster makes
 * from where it is bolted, and the inertia tensor decides what angular acceleration that torque
 * actually produces. A design that keeps only a single "weight" scalar can express none of the three
 * questions players care about — why a loaded ship is sluggish, why an unevenly loaded one pulls to
 * one side, and why a long ship rolls more readily than it yaws.</p>
 *
 * <p>The split into structural, content and crew is not decoration: structure changes only when the
 * hull is built on or broken, while content and crew change constantly and without any block ever
 * changing. Keeping them apart is what lets the expensive half be recomputed rarely and the cheap
 * half often, and it is also what the pre-flight readout shows — "1000 t of ship, 500 t of cargo" is
 * a sentence a player can act on in a way that "1500 t" is not.</p>
 *
 * <p>The frame is <b>derived</b>: it is computed from the hull and its contents and is never saved.
 * A saved characteristic goes stale the moment somebody welds a plate on, and a stale ship
 * characteristic is worse than an absent one because it looks authoritative.</p>
 *
 * <p>Frames are immutable; build one with {@link ShipMassFrameBuilder}.</p>
