/**
 * Turns a pile of {@link MassContributor}s into a {@link ShipMassFrame}.
 *
 * <p>Accumulates in one pass and finishes in another, so the caller may hand over contributors in
 * any order and from any source — the hull scan, a tank's fluid, a seated crewman — without knowing
 * what came before. Adding is commutative and associative to within floating-point rounding, which
 * matters because the order blocks arrive in is an accident of chunk iteration and must not be
 * something the ship's handling depends on.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the inertia is accumulated the way it is.</b> The tensor must end up expressed about the
 * centre of mass, but the centre of mass is not known until every contributor has been seen. Rather
 * than making two passes over the contributors, this class accumulates the second moments about the
 * ORIGIN and shifts the whole result to the centre of mass once at the end, which is the parallel-axis
 * theorem applied in reverse and is exact, not an approximation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each contributor also carries its own box inertia. Without it, a hull whose blocks are collinear
 * — a mast, a girder, a one-block-wide antenna — produces a tensor with a zero eigenvalue about the
 * line, and inverting that is a division by zero on the physics thread. With it, every non-empty
 * ship has a positive-definite tensor by construction.</p>
