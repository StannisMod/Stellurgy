/**
 * Walks what was built around a gun's controller and answers what it adds up to.
 *
 * <h3>Connectivity, not a template</h3>
 * <p>A gun is the connected run of parts touching its controller — there is no fixed shape to
 * match. That is what makes the contract addable-to: a part shipped by somebody else joins a gun by
 * being placed against one, and the walk that finds it was not written knowing it exists. It also
 * means "bigger gun" is a thing a player builds rather than a tier they unlock.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Bounded on purpose</h3>
 * <p>The walk stops at {@link #MAX_PARTS}. Without a bound, a player who paves a hull in barrel
 * sections gets one gun with a five-figure part count and a rebuild that walks it every time a
 * block changes. The cap is a bound on WORK, and a build that reaches it is still a working gun —
 * it is simply not credited for parts past the limit.</p>
