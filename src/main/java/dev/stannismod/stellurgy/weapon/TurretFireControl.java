/**
 * The seam between a gun that sits somewhere and a round that flies through the world.
 *
 * <h3>Two frames, and the gun only ever knows one</h3>
 * <p>A turret bolted to a ship has a position in that ship's SUBSPACE and turns with the hull; its
 * bearing is therefore held in the ship's frame, and a hull that rolls carries the barrel with it
 * exactly as it carries the deck. A turret on the ground has no such frame and holds its bearing in
 * the world's. Both are the same code: the ship id is either there or null, and every conversion
 * below is a no-op in the second case.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The round leaves in world coordinates, always</h3>
 * <p>The projectile substrate integrates in the world frame — that is where the target, the shields
 * and everybody watching are. So the last thing this class does before handing a shot over is
 * convert, and it converts the muzzle POINT and the aim DIRECTION separately, because a rotation
 * applied to a position is one of the two mistakes this seam exists to prevent. The other is
 * forgetting that a gun on a moving ship inherits its motion: a round fired from a hull doing 40
 * blocks a tick and given only its own muzzle speed is a round fired backwards.</p>
