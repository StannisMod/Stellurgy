/**
 * What a weapons network agrees on: where it is pointing, and whether it may shoot.
 *
 * <h3>One target, held by the network rather than by a console</h3>
 * <p>Two consoles on one network cannot disagree, because neither of them owns this — they both
 * edit it. That also survives the console being broken and rebuilt, and it is what makes "assign a
 * target" a network-level act rather than a message a console has to keep re-sending to each gun.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Hold-fire is a separate switch from having a target</h3>
 * <p>Aiming and shooting are different decisions: a battery tracking an approaching ship without
 * firing on it is the normal state of a defended station. So clearing the target is not how one
 * stops the shooting, and holding fire does not make the guns forget where the enemy is.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What a human said outranks what a machine found</h3>
 * <p>An assigned target and an acquired one are kept in separate fields rather than one field
 * written by both. A sensor refreshing its contact every few ticks would otherwise silently overrule
 * the order a player gave a minute ago, and the player would have no way to hold a target the sensor
 * disagrees about. So the acquisition is only consulted when nobody has said anything.</p>
