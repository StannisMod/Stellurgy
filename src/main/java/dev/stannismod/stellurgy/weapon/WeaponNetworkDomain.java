/**
 * The weapons network: energy shared between guns, and one place to point them all.
 *
 * <h3>The network is a convenience, and nothing depends on it</h3>
 * <p>Every gun works alone. It holds its own energy buffer, picks its own target and fires with no
 * cable, console or network attached — a battery of one is a supported build, not a degraded one.
 * What joining a network buys is what a player would otherwise do by hand: one console aiming a
 * dozen guns at the same thing, and a shared supply that fills the guns that matter first under a
 * deficit. Losing the network loses those conveniences and nothing else, which is why no code path
 * below asks whether a state exists before deciding whether a gun may fire.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The commodity is Forge Energy</h3>
 * <p>Guns are sinks, generators and capacitor banks are sources, and the unit is FE per tick — the
 * same unit the rest of the mod's power is in, so a player wiring a gun into a ship's supply is not
 * learning a second kind of energy.</p>
