/**
 * The traverse: a bearing, the limits it may take, the rate it may change at, and what happens when
 * the drive stops working.
 *
 * <h3>A mechanism, not a pair of angles</h3>
 * <p>The mount is the first of several things in this mod that are commanded rather than set — an
 * engine gimbal and a landing gear are the same shape. So the state here is deliberately the whole
 * shape: where it IS, where it was TOLD to go, whether that command was inside what the build can
 * do, and which failure it is in. A caller reads the current bearing and gets the truth in every
 * one of those cases, including the ones where the truth is "wherever it seized".</p>
 *
 * <h3>Saturation is visible, never a silent clamp</h3>
 * <p>Commanding a bearing outside the declared arc does not quietly snap to the nearest legal one
 * and report success. The mount goes as far as it may and {@link #isSaturated()} stays true for as
 * long as the command is out of reach, so a console can show a player that the target is behind the
 * hull rather than leaving them to wonder why nothing is being hit.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Angles</h3>
 * <p>Yaw is degrees clockwise from south in Minecraft's own convention, so a bearing computed from
 * a direction vector here matches one computed anywhere else in the game. Pitch is degrees, positive
 * DOWN — again Minecraft's convention — and the elevation limits are expressed in it, so a limit
 * read off this class means the same thing as one read off an entity.</p>
