/**
 * The last rung of the failure ladder: past a point the ship stops being damaged and starts being
 * gone.
 *
 * <p><b>The subject is the block, and the driver is whichever of three things is hottest.</b> A block
 * can be cooked by the air of the compartment it stands in, by the coolant loop it is welded to, or
 * by what the outside is pouring onto it - and the rung takes the MAXIMUM of the three rather than
 * any one of them, because a hull plate inside a star does not care that the pipes behind it are
 * cold. That is the whole reason this is not simply "the loop got hot".</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What melts is decided by the material, never by a list of blocks.</b> The same table that
 * says how much heat a slug of iron carries says the temperature at which iron stops being iron, so
 * a modded metal nobody has heard of melts at its own point with no code written for it, and a block
 * whose substance is unknown melts at no temperature at all rather than at a guessed one.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What it leaves behind.</b> Rock and metal leave lava - a melt is a melt, and the mess is the
 * consequence the design asks for. Everything else is simply gone: a molten pane of glass or a
 * carbonised crate leaving a pool of stone-lava would be a worse lie than leaving nothing.</p>
