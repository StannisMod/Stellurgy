 * A charged slug after it leaves the ship: a hot object on the same physics as everything else.

 * <p>Nothing here is a special case for an ejected item. A slug is a lump of matter carrying energy,
 * so it does what a lump of matter carrying energy does - it cools by the same quartic law a radiator
 * sheds on, it melts what it lands on by SPENDING that energy (which is why it self-limits rather
 * than burning through a planet), and it burns whoever picks it up while it is still holding
 * anything. Once it has spent what it took it is an ordinary block of iron again, and the only thing
 * the player lost is the trip it made.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The temperature is derived, never stored.</b> What is written on the stack is ENERGY; how hot
 * that makes the lump depends on how much lump there is, which is the same arithmetic the dump used
 * to charge it. Storing a temperature instead would let a nugget and a block of the same metal carry
 * the same heat.</p>
