/**
 * What a material is worth thermally: how much heat a lump of it can carry before it stops being a
 * lump.
 *
 * <p>Three real properties and nothing else - density, specific heat, and the temperature at which
 * the solid gives up. Everything the thermal system needs from a material is DERIVED from these,
 * which is the whole point: a slug's capacity is a consequence of what it is made of rather than a
 * number somebody typed next to an item, and the same three figures decide when a block of it melts.
 * One table, two consumers.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The ceiling is not always a melting point, and calling it one would be wrong.</b> Metals
 * melt; water boils away at 373 K and never melts at all; graphite does not melt at ordinary pressure
 * but SUBLIMES near 3 900 K. What they have in common is the temperature past which you no longer
 * have a solid object to throw, so that is what is stored and what the name says.</p>
 *
 * <p>The numbers are ordinary physics and are quoted in SI (kg/m3, J/kg.K, K), not in game units.
 * Converting to the heat unit happens once, at the point of use, so a reader can check any row of
 * this table against a handbook.</p>
