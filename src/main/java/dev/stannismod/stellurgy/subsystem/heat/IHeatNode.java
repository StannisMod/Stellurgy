 * A block that is part of the coolant loop's thermal mass — a pipe, an accumulator.

 * have a temperature of its own; what it has is a heat CAPACITY, and a share of the loop's energy
 * proportional to it. The share is what each block writes down, which is why it is here rather than
 * in the network state: a network has no durable name to be saved under and is rebuilt from the
 * world every time anything is placed, while a block has its position. It also makes splitting
 * physical for free — cut a loop in half and each half keeps the energy its own blocks were
 * holding, which is the same temperature on both sides.
