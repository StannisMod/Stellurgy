/**
 * The coolant loop: the pipes, accumulators and radiators a ship uses to get its machines' waste heat
 * to somewhere it can be thrown away.
 * <p>
 * <b>The commodity is ENERGY, and its unit is a heat unit per tick</b> — the same currency the
 * machines run on, so a reactor's draw, a chiller's work and the energy sitting in the pipes are one
 * number and never need converting. Every surface a player reads calls it a heat unit and never an
 * energy one: naming it after the electricity it came from would say the heat can be put back to
 * work, and it cannot.
 * <p>
 * <b>Heat does not FLOW inside a loop.</b> A connected loop is one thermodynamic object with one
 * temperature, so there is nothing for the shared network solver to move between its members. What
 * the primitive contributes is membership — which blocks are one loop — and the energy arrives by
 * generation, moves between loops through chillers, and leaves through radiators.
 * <p>
 * <b>Two loops are how a heat pump is expressed.</b> A ship's machines heat one loop; a chiller moves
 * that heat into a second one and pays for it; the second loop therefore runs hot, and radiated power
 * is quartic in temperature, so it sheds several times what the first could. Nobody sets the hot
 * loop's temperature: energy accumulates in it against its own capacity and the temperature follows,
 * which is what makes it a real reservoir a burst can heat.
