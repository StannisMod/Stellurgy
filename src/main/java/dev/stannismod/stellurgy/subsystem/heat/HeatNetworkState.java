 * temperature, and everything a player sees about heat inside the ship is read off this. The three
 * numbers here are a READOUT recomputed from the loop's blocks every tick, never the record: the
 * energy is written down block by block ({@link IHeatNode}), because a network is rebuilt from the
 * world whenever anything is placed and has no name of its own to be saved under. That is also why
 * copying this state when a loop splits creates nothing — the copy is overwritten from the members
 * on the next tick, and the members are the two halves of what there was.
