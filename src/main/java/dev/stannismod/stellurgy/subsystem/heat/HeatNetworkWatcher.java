/**
 * The second half of "a machine is not a network node": a chunk arriving can put a heat-making
 * machine next to a loop that is already built and already knows its neighbours.
 * <p>
 * The loop block's own neighbour notification covers everything that is PLACED, whoever placed it.
 * It does not cover a machine that was already there and simply came back with its chunk, because
 * loading a chunk notifies nobody. So a chunk load invalidates the cached neighbours, and the loop
 * works them out again on its next tick.
 * <p>
 * This costs nothing where nothing uses it: with no heat node registered anywhere the domain is
 * never ticked, so the flag this sets is never read. Where it does apply, a rebuild is coalesced to
 * at most one per tick however many chunks arrive.
