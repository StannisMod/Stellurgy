 * A machine that moves heat OUT of the coolant loop it sits in — today a radiator, later a chiller

 * currently has, and the thermal system computes the energy from the loop's own temperature. That is
 * the whole guard on this seam: emitting heat is a cost and so an open extension point for it
 * polices itself, while REMOVING heat is a benefit — an interface that let a machine name the amount
 * would let one mod ship a "heat absorber" and switch the entire mechanic off. The same discipline
 * as a slug's capacity being derived from its material and never authored.
 * <p>
 * <b>And heat may not VANISH here.</b> Everything on this seam is a TRANSFER: it ends up somewhere
 * that is either outside the ship for good (a radiator radiates it away) or in another reservoir
 * still aboard. A second kind of exchanger adds a kind selector to say which formula applies to it,
 * not a second interface — otherwise there end up being two ways for heat to leave a loop and only
 * one of them is safe to expose.
