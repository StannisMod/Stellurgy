/**
 * Throwing matter out of a hull, done once for everyone who needs to.
 * <p>
 * Two subsystems eject solid objects overboard — life support sheds the carbon its scrubbers pull
 * out of the air, and the thermal system fires charged heat slugs when rejection cannot win. They
 * are deliberately DIFFERENT machines: charging a slug to just under its melting point needs
 * materials and a duty cycle an ordinary airlock has no business carrying, and the thermal dump is
 * required to be unusable as a steady state while the carbon sink IS one. What they share is this —
 * the act itself, which is fiddlier than it looks aboard a ship.
 * <p>
 * <b>The clearance walk needs no frame conversion, and the ejection does.</b> A ship's blocks live
 * in a stationary subspace and that is exactly where the world stores them, so asking "are the next
 * few blocks along my facing empty?" is ordinary block arithmetic and is correct on a flying ship
 * without touching a transform. An item ENTITY, on the other hand, lives in the world frame, so the
 * spawn crosses the seam and every part of it must be mapped.
