/**
 * A gun's controller: the one block that knows what was built around it, where it is pointing, and
 * when it may shoot.
 *
 * <h3>It works alone</h3>
 * <p>Nothing below asks whether a network exists before deciding to aim or to fire. A turret with a
 * target, a charged buffer and a barrel shoots — on the ground, on a ship, wired to nothing. A
 * network, when there is one, can point it somewhere else and can feed it faster; that is the whole
 * of the difference, and it is a difference in convenience rather than in capability.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The build is re-read when it CHANGES</h3>
 * <p>A block cannot enter or leave the world without its own {@code onBlockAdded} / {@code breakBlock}
 * running, so "the build changed" is a fact the world hands us rather than something to go looking
 * for: a part marks every controller it can reach, and the walk happens on the next tick. There is no
 * polling — a gun that nobody is building is a gun that costs one boolean check per tick.</p>
