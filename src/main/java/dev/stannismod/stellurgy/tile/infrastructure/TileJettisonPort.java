/**
 * An airlock that throws what is put in it overboard.
 * <p>
 * Life support's scrubbers pull carbon out of the air and leave it as dust in an output slot, and a
 * full slot backs the machine up rather than deleting the carbon — so a closed air loop needs
 * somewhere for the carbon to GO. This is that somewhere. The honest accounting: the carbon entered
 * the air as exhaled CO2 whose carbon came from imported food, so venting it exports imported mass
 * rather than breaking the oxygen loop, which stays closed.
 * <p>
 * It is deliberately a plain block — no power, no chemistry, a hole with a door. The thermal
 * system's emergency dump throws things overboard too, but it is a different machine: charging a
 * slug to just under its melting point needs materials and a duty cycle an airlock has no business
 * carrying, and that machine is meant to be unusable as a steady state where this one IS one. What
 * the two share is {@link EjectionPort}, the act itself.
 * <p>
 * Nothing restricts what may be jettisoned. Carbon dust is what the loop produces, but a port that
 * accepted only dust would be a worse block for no reason.
