/**
 * The air-intake duct: what gives a chiller a cold side made of COMPARTMENT AIR instead of coolant.
 * <p>
 * <b>It is not plumbing and it stores nothing.</b> A chiller on its own talks only to coolant loops;
 * bolt one of these to its cold face and the machine draws from the room instead. Everything the duct
 * does is answer one question — which zone am I breathing from — so that the thermal system can take
 * heat out of that zone's air and the chiller can pay to put it somewhere hotter.
 * <p>
 * <b>Where it sits is the whole interface.</b> It occupies the chiller's cold face, which is the
 * position the machine already computes for the loop it would otherwise draw from. That makes the two
 * kinds of cold side mutually exclusive by geometry rather than by a precedence rule nobody would
 * remember: the block in that place is either coolant or a duct, and whichever it is decides what the
 * chiller is cooling.
 * <p>
 * <b>The zone it serves is a NEIGHBOUR, never its own position.</b> A zone is made of air cells and
 * the block occupying a solid position is by definition not one of them, so a duct set into a wall
 * would otherwise resolve nothing and sit idle forever. This is the same rule the recirculator learnt
 * the hard way, and it gives the natural behaviour for a duct built into a partition: it breathes from
 * one of the rooms it touches rather than from neither.
