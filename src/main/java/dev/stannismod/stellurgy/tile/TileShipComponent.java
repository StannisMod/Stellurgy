/**
 * A block that belongs to one ship and has to keep belonging to it.
 *
 * <p>Every machine a ship's flight depends on has the same problem: it must be able to say WHICH
 * ship it is part of, and the answer has to survive the ship being cut out of the world and pasted
 * somewhere else — which happens on every assembly, every entry into space and every jump. An
 * absolute position survives none of those. A position RELATIVE to the flight computer survives all
 * of them, because a ship's blocks move as one rigid body.</p>
 *
 * <p>So the link is an offset, recorded once by the assembler while the whole craft is still sitting
 * on the pad, and read back with a plain lookup at {@code pos + offset} afterwards. A machine that
 * was never assembled into a ship — one sitting in a workshop, or a spare on a shelf — simply has no
 * link, and nothing on a ship will ever mistake it for part of one.</p>
