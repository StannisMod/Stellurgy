/**
 * What the gravity dampeners spare the crew when a flight ends badly.
 *
 * <p>A planned arrival costs nobody anything. An emergency exit — the window collapsing mid-flight —
 * dumps the transit's speed into everything aboard, and a dampener is what stands between that and a
 * crew smeared along the far bulkhead.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two levers, because one dampener for a shuttle and for a dreadnought is no lever at all:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Tier</b> decides how much speed a dampener eats. Above that, what is left through.</li>
 *   <li><b>Coverage</b> decides who is protected: a crew member is covered when a powered dampener
 *       is close enough to him at the moment the window fails. A big ship needs several.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here runs per tick. It is sampled once, at the exit.</p>
