/**
 * How a machine of this family measures itself: it walks outward from its controller through the
 * component blocks welded to it and counts what it finds.
 *
 * <p>This is the whole of the "bigger machine, better machine" lever. A fixed structure template
 * cannot express it — a template is one size by definition — so the machines here are scanned
 * rather than pattern-matched, exactly the way a rocket's stats are scanned off its build.</p>
 *
 * <p>The walk is deliberately dumb: six-neighbour connectivity, one shared budget, and a hard cap on
 * how many blocks it will visit. The cap is not a balance number that happens to be enforced here —
 * it is what keeps a scan on a pilot's key press from walking a whole ship.</p>
