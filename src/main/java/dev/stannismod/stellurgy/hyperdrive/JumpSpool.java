/**
 * The moment between deciding to jump and jumping: the spool, and the second look a warning buys.
 *
 * <p>Two things are being kept honest here. The first is that <b>nothing is spent until the window
 * opens</b> — a pilot who changes his mind while the drive winds up walks away having paid nothing,
 * which is what makes a spool a decision point rather than a delay. The second is that a warning has
 * to be <b>read</b> to be confirmed: a pilot meets an advisory, is told what it is, and only a
 * second, deliberate press inside a short window commits him. One press can never both raise a
 * warning and answer it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not persisted. A spool interrupted by a server restart resolves the same way an
 * abort does, and free is the correct price for a jump that never happened.</p>
