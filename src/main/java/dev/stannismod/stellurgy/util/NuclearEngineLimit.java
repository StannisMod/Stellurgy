 * What a cluster of nuclear nozzles is actually allowed to produce once its reactor cores are

 *
 * <p>Nuclear motors cannot be throttled individually — a nozzle that does not get full power
 * shuts off — so the cluster runs only as many nozzles as the cores can feed, and its working
 * fluid draw drops in the same proportion. The three scan paths (rocket assembler, unmanned
 * vehicle assembler, and the packed {@link StorageChunk}) all need that derating and used to
 * carry their own copy of the arithmetic.</p>
 *
 * <p>The intermediate products are computed in {@code long}: thrust is in newtons, so a stack of
 * reactor cores runs into tens of millions and {@code use * nozzleThrust} overflows {@code int}
 * well inside buildable rocket sizes.</p>
