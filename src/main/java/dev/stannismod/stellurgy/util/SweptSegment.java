/**
 * Every block a straight segment passes through, in the order it passes through them.
 *
 * <h3>Why not "sample the path every block"</h3>
 * <p>Because sampling misses things and nobody can say which. Stepping a unit distance along the ray
 * and reading the block at each sample walks past a voxel whenever the ray clips its corner, and the
 * shape of what it misses depends on the angle — so a wall that stops a shot from the front lets it
 * through at forty degrees, intermittently. This is an exact traversal (Amanatides &amp; Woo): it
 * yields the voxels the segment actually enters, in order, with the parameter at which it enters
 * each. No step size, so no speed at which a wall becomes transparent.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Pure</h3>
 * <p>Nothing here touches a world. It is geometry, and it is unit-testable as geometry — which is the
 * point, because the property that matters ("a fast segment does not skip a block") is a property of
 * the traversal, not of the blocks it happens to find.</p>
