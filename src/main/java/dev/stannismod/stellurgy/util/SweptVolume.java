/**
 * Every block a body of some WIDTH sweeps through, layer by layer, in the order it reaches them.
 *
 * <h3>Why a width at all</h3>
 * <p>A ray says a shot meets one block per step, which makes every calibre the same shot with a
 * different number on it. A swept cylinder is what makes the difference a player is being sold exist
 * INSIDE the hull rather than only at its skin: a heavy slug punches a wide hole, a needle bores a
 * narrow channel. The volume is the body's disc dragged along the segment.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Layers, not blocks</h3>
 * <p>The blocks reached within one slice of the axis form one <b>layer</b>, and a layer is handed over
 * as a set. Without that there is no coherent place to divide the body's energy: a shot that reaches
 * nine blocks either does nine times the work or picks one of them arbitrarily. Each block in a layer
 * carries its <b>share</b> — how much of the cross-section it covers — and a layer's shares sum to
 * one, so widening a body spreads what it has instead of multiplying it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Exact along the path, quadrature across it</h3>
 * <p>Along the axis this is the same exact traversal a ray gets ({@link SweptSegment}) — there is no
 * step size and therefore no speed at which a wall becomes transparent. ACROSS the axis a cell's
 * share is measured by testing a fixed set of points in it, which is a different axis and a different
 * claim: the quadrature decides how much of a block is covered, never whether the path reached it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>A narrow body is a ray, exactly</h3>
 * <p>Below half a block the volume degenerates to the segment itself, one block per layer at a share
 * of one. That is not an approximation of the cylinder — it is the statement that a body thinner than
 * a voxel has nothing to spread, and it keeps the reference body (radius 0.25) behaving precisely as
 * it did before there was a width.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Pure</h3>
 * <p>Nothing here touches a world. It is geometry, and the property that matters — that a wide fast
 * body does not skip what it passes through — is a property of the traversal.</p>
