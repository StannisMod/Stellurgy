/**
 * What the ship-was-named announcement actually said, kept so a test can check it.
 *
 * <p>The property under test is an EDGE — "this fired exactly once, for this ship, with this cause" —
 * and an edge cannot be read off the world afterwards: by the time anything asks, the ship is simply
 * named, which is what it would look like whether the announcement fired once, three times, or not at
 * all. So the announcements themselves are recorded.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Keyed by the ship's own identity</h2>
 *
 * <p>Per-ship counts are keyed on the physics identity carried by the event, never on which ship was
 * nearest a point or which one happened to move last. A scenario with two craft in one world — a
 * crossing that lands beside a parked hull is exactly that — would otherwise attribute one ship's
 * edge to the other and read as a plausible pass.</p>
 *
 * <p>The durable id is recorded beside it because the two answer different questions: the physics
 * identity names a REGISTRATION, and a craft that crosses gets a new one, while the durable id names
 * the VESSEL and survives. A consumer that must not act twice for one vessel is checked against the
 * second, and a readout carrying only the first could not tell whether it did.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Every field in every state</h2>
 *
 * <p>A ship nothing has been recorded for reports zeroes, not a missing object: "nothing happened
 * here" is usually the interesting answer, and an instrument that expresses it by changing its own
 * shape breaks the consumer that came to read it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Bounded.</b> The per-ship table evicts its oldest entry past a cap and the timeline is capped
 * too, so a long session cannot grow this without limit. Eviction is counted and reported, so a
 * reading taken after the fact can say whether it is looking at the whole history or at the tail of
 * one.</p>
