/**
 * What a brand-new memory crystal already knows.
 *
 * <p>A first crystal is not blank. It carries the address of the world the pilot came from, plus the
 * places the setting treats as common knowledge. Without that, a player's first navigation computer
 * would have nowhere at all to point, and the only way to get a first address would be to fly blind
 * to a coordinate typed at random.</p>
 *
 * <p>What counts as common knowledge is {@code planetsMustBeDiscovered}'s question, and it is asked
 * here: with discovery OFF (the default) every authored body is seeded, because nothing in that
 * regime is meant to need discovering; with it ON, only the bodies the pack author marked known.
 * Either way the home body's own cell is skipped — see the loop.</p>
 *
 * <p>Everything seeded here is recorded at {@link InfoTier#TELESCOPE}: common knowledge is knowing a
 * place exists, not having surveyed it.</p>
