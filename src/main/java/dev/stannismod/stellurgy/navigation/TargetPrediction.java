/**
 * Where to aim at a moving destination.
 *
 * <p>A jump takes time, and in that time the destination moves. Not its NAME — a cell name is
 * durable, so the cell a ship arrives into is the cell it aimed at, at every tick, and that half
 * needs no projection at all. What moves is the POINT: the body's cell frame slides along the body's
 * orbit, a moon slides inside that frame, and both are somewhere else by the time the ship comes out
 * of hyperspace. Aiming at where the destination is NOW therefore prices the wrong flight and puts
 * the ship down at the wrong end of the neighbourhood.</p>
 *
 * <p>The aim point and the flight time depend on each other: a further aim point means a longer flight,
 * and a longer flight means the body has moved further. This resolves that by <b>bounded iteration</b>
 * — price the flight to where the body is now, re-aim at where it will be when that flight ends, and
 * repeat. It stops the moment two passes agree on BOTH the flight time and the aim point, and in any
 * case after {@link #MAX_PASSES} passes, so a pathological orbit costs a fixed handful of trig calls
 * rather than spinning. Not converging is not a failure: the last pass is still a far better aim than
 * the present position, which is what the unpredicted code did.</p>
 *
 * <p>The convergence test used to be {@code next.sameCell(aim)} — which, once names became durable,
 * is satisfied on pass 1 by construction and made the whole iteration a no-op. The test belongs on
 * the point, which is what actually moves.</p>
 *
 * <p>Pure — the ephemeris, the flight-time law and the frames the distance is measured through are all
 * injected, so the aiming rule can be checked without a world, a registry or a drive.</p>
