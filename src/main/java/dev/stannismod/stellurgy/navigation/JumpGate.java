/**
 * Whether a ship may jump, and what the pilot should be told if it may not.
 *
 * <p>The gate is <b>free and read-only</b>: asking costs nothing and consumes nothing, so a refusal is
 * never a loss. Everything expensive happens after it, at the trigger's commit point.</p>
 *
 * <p>It answers in <b>two tiers</b>, because not every objection is a veto:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Severity#HARD} — physically impossible. The jump does not happen.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Severity#ADVISORY} — possible but ill-advised. The pilot is told what is wrong and may
 *       confirm anyway; flying into a bad idea on purpose is a decision the game leaves to him.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class owns every clause a jump has (a nav computer aboard, a known position, a target, a
 * drive, the burst that opens the window, the energy for the flight) and the fixed order of the
 * stages, so there is exactly one place that decides whether a ship may jump. A new precondition is
 * a clause added here, never a gate of its own. Order matters only for which message the pilot reads
 * first — every clause is free, so all of them run.</p>
