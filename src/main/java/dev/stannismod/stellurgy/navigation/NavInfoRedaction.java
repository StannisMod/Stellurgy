/**
 * What a nav computer is allowed to tell its pilot about a body.
 *
 * <p>Knowledge here is earned by <b>getting closer</b>. From across the galaxy a body is a coordinate,
 * a name and the coarse things a telescope can see; inside its system you can read its surface; only
 * from its own zone do you see what is actually on it. The crystal's recorded detail is a memory of a
 * past observation and counts too — you do not forget a planet you once orbited by flying away.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class decides the tier and drops every field above it. It is deliberately pure: the point of
 * the redaction is that the SERVER applies it before anything crosses the wire, so a client that never
 * receives a field cannot leak it, however the GUI is modified.</p>

     * comparing cell keys is exactly right and needs no tick at all.</p>
