/**
 * Resolves a shield block's <b>domain</b> — D134-6 Layer 1 (identity). A domain <em>bounds</em> the
 * shield configuration; it is never a credential and is never "entered". One hull = one shield domain,
 * so every console on a ship edits the same configuration and destroying one console loses nothing.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds exist. A block managed by a Valkyrien Skies ship belongs to that ship's domain, which
 * follows the hull wherever it flies (the same {@code shipIdManagingBlock} resolution the field frame
 * uses, so frame and domain can never disagree). Everything else — a planet base, an asteroid outpost —
 * belongs to its dimension's domain. Base identity has no first-class concept in Stellurgy yet, so a dimension
 * is the coarsest defensible bound: two bases in one dimension share a <em>group namespace</em> (their
 * group names appear in each other's consoles), which costs nothing physically because a group only
 * pushes a priority into the member emitters it actually lists.</p>
