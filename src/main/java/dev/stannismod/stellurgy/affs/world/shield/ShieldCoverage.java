/**
 * "Is this block under the field right now?" — the one question a subsystem that is not the shield
 * needs to ask of it.
 * <p>
 * It exists so that a caller elsewhere in the mod does not have to know either half of the answer: that
 * the field is an SDF smooth-union of emitter spheres, and that an emitter's centre is a WORLD point
 * while a block on a ship is addressed in that ship's subspace. Both live here, and a caller that
 * copied them would be one refactor away from asking the shell about a position it never occupied.
 * <p>
 * <b>Asking costs the shield nothing.</b> This is a geometry read, not a {@link ShieldStrike}: nothing
 * is absorbed, no shield energy is spent, and the field is not weakened by being stood under. A caller
 * that needs the shield to PAY for what it stopped declares a strike instead.
