/**
 * The "responsible area" method (D134-3): partition the composite field surface into per-emitter
 * <em>zones</em> so that <b>each surface point belongs to its nearest emitter</b> — a Voronoi partition
 * over the emitter centres. A zone's regeneration rate is its emitter's throughput and its reserve is
 * that emitter's coil, so knowing which emitter owns a point is the substrate the zoned balancing
 * (per-zone drop/regen, and later the redistribution control surface) stands on.
 *
 * <p>Pure geometry: no world access, no side effects. Membership is decided by centre distance, which
 * is the standard Voronoi cell test; the composite surface itself is a smooth-union of the same centres
 * ({@link FieldSurfaceMath}), so the nearest-centre owner is a faithful reading of "whose part of the
 * shell is this."</p>
