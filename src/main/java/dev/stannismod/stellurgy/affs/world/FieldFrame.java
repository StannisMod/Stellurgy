/**
 * The frame seam (§4.3): a shield network is <em>entirely</em> standalone (world-frame) or
 * <em>entirely</em> on one Valkyrien Skies ship (subspace-frame), never mixed. This interface hides that
 * choice from the field geometry so the same SDF / collision / deflection code runs in both cases.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the seam is small.</b> The field is a smooth-union of <em>spheres</em> centred at emitter
 * positions, and a sphere is rotation-invariant: a sphere at field-frame centre {@code C} with radius
 * {@code r} is, in world space, a sphere at {@code fieldToWorld(C)} with the <em>same</em> {@code r}.
 * So the field never has to be un-rotated — everything stays world-frame once each emitter's centre is
 * mapped out to world. The only genuinely frame-dependent quantities are (1) that world centre and
 * (2) the shell's own velocity, which the impact/deflection math must subtract so a cruising ship does
 * not bill its own crew (§4.3 point 3, the one place a naive port is silently wrong).</p>
 *
 * <p>Standalone is the identity frame ({@link WorldFieldFrame}); the ship frame ({@link ShipFieldFrame})
 * delegates to {@code VSIntegration}. A ship frame that cannot resolve (ship unloaded) reports
 * {@link #isReady()} = false and its emitter degrades to off (Q4 fail-open) rather than projecting a
 * shell at the wrong place.</p>
