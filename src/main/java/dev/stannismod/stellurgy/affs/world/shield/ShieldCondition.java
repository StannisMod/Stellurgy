/**
 * What a shield block's CONDITION does to what it delivers.
 *
 * <p>The stage is PULLED from the world, never pushed: nothing tells a shield generator it was shot.
 * A node reads the stage of the block it lives in when it needs it, which is one map lookup, and
 * which survives a save, a chunk reload and a hull being reassembled for free — because the stage
 * does. Nothing about damage appears in the network solve, and nothing about shields appears in the
 * damage engine.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two different consequences live here because a shield has two kinds of organ:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a <b>scalar</b> node — a generator converts less, a cable carries less, an accumulator holds
 *       less — which is the same shape a worn motor's thrust already has;</li>
 *   <li>an <b>emitter</b>, whose consequence is its RADIUS. A shrinking sphere is the one failure a
 *       player can see BEFORE it matters: the shell draws in, zone ownership shifts, and a stretch
 *       of hull that used to be covered stops being covered while there is still time to react.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Neither is gated on the wear config flag. That flag gates where wear ACCRUES; a consequence read
 * unconditionally is the whole reason a ship shot to pieces stops working, and gating it would let a
 * modpack that turned wear off field indestructible shields.</p>
