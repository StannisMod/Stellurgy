/**
 * Outcome of {@link ShieldStrikeService#resolve} (D134-2). Either the strike never met a powered shell
 * ({@link #passed()} — nothing absorbed, the weapon applies its full effect), or it was intercepted:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>fully</b> — the shield paid the whole cost; {@link #getResidualImpactEnergy()} is 0 and the
 *       weapon's effect stops at {@link #getHitPoint()} (a flash at the crossing);</li>
 *   <li><b>partially</b> — the shield spent everything it had but could not cover the cost; the
 *       remainder passes downstream ({@code residualImpactEnergy > 0}) and the shield is drained toward
 *       zero. This is the graceful-penetration "shields fall" case (D134-2), the same degrade shape as
 *       the kinetic path where a downed shield lets a body through.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A fully absorbed strike that declared a <em>travelling body</em> is additionally
 * {@link #reflected}: the shield mirrored the body off the shell and hands back its new velocity, so the
 * shot resumes at {@link #getHitPoint()} rather than ending there. Reflection is a <b>specialisation of
 * full interception</b>, not a fourth state — a caller that has never heard of it still reads
 * "intercepted, fully absorbed, nothing passed", which remains true.</p>
