 *       weapon's effect stops at {@link #getHitPoint()} (a flash at the crossing);</li>
 *   <li><b>partially</b> — the shield spent everything it had but could not cover the cost; the
 *       remainder passes downstream ({@code residualImpactEnergy > 0}) and the shield is drained toward
 *       zero. This is the graceful-penetration "shields fall" case (D134-2), the same degrade shape as
