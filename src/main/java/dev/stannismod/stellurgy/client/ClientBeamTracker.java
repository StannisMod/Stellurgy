 *
 * <h3>A beam that stops being mentioned goes out</h3>
 * <p>A held beam ends for reasons a client cannot see — the trigger released, the feed run dry, the
 * gun destroyed, the chunk unloaded, the player having walked out of range while it burned. Some of
 * those send an "it went out" packet and some cannot, so the drawing is kept alive by the server
 * repeating itself: a beam nobody has mentioned for {@link #STALE_TICKS} ticks is dropped. That
 * makes the worst case a beam drawn for a fraction of a second too long, instead of one burning
 * across the sky until the player relogs.</p>
