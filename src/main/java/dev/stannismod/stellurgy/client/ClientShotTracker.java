/**
 * The client's own copy of what is in the air, kept only so it can be drawn.
 *
 * <h3>It simulates nothing the game reads</h3>
 * <p>Every round here is a picture. It is stepped with the same arithmetic the server uses, from the
 * numbers the server sent, and if the two ever disagree the server is right and this one is simply
 * wrong for a few frames until an end packet corrects it. Nothing in the mod asks this class a
 * question — that is what makes it safe for it to be approximate, and it is why the shot layer's
 * own comment that a client "never steps one" is still true: it steps a drawing, not a shot.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Held here rather than in the world</h3>
 * <p>A client shot has no block, no entity and no chunk, so there is nowhere in the world for it to
 * live. It is cleared when the player leaves a world, because a round from the last dimension drawn
 * over the new one is worse than no round at all.</p>
