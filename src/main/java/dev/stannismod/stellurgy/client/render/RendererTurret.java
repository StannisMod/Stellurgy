/**
 * Draws the barrel a turret cannot have as blocks.
 *
 * <h3>Why the barrel is drawn rather than built</h3>
 * <p>A block occupies a grid cell at one of a handful of fixed orientations, so a gun made of blocks
 * cannot point at anything that is not on those axes. The mount's bearing is therefore a pair of
 * angles the game keeps, and this renderer is the only thing that turns them into something a player
 * can see. The parts a player builds are the gun's EQUIPMENT — feed, cooling, barrel sections that
 * lengthen it — and the barrel drawn here is as long as the build earned.</p>
 *
 * <h3>It draws the client's own mechanism</h3>
 * <p>The client runs the same traverse the server does, from the command it was sent, so the barrel
 * swings at the declared rate instead of teleporting between synced poses. When the two disagree the
 * next command corrects the client silently — nothing here is authoritative for anything.</p>
