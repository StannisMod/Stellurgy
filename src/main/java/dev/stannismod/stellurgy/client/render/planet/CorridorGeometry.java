 * Where the hyperspace corridor's rings sit, and how bright they are.
 *
 * <p>The corridor is the only thing that tells a pilot in transit that he is moving: he has no
 * controls, no bodies in the sky and no number counting down. So two things about it are contract
 * and not polish:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A ring gets CLOSER as time passes.</b> That is what reads as travelling forward. Rings
 *       that recede instead read, unmistakably, as flying backwards.</li>
 *   <li><b>The ring at the viewer's nose is invisible.</b> A ring at full brightness on top of the
 *       camera pops into existence in the middle of the screen.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>How many rings there are, how far apart, how wide and how fast they travel are all
 * {@code tunable} and are deliberately not part of that contract.</p>
 *
 * <p>Pure arithmetic — no GL, no client state — so both rules can be checked without a client.
 * {@link HyperspaceTunnel} is then only the drawing.</p>
