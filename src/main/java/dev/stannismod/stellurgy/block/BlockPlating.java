/**
 * A thin skin that clings to whichever face it was put on — what "armour is a COATING" has to mean in
 * a world made of cubes.
 *
 * <h3>Why a facing, and not a slab</h3>
 * <p>A slab is a half block that lives at the top or the bottom of its own, so cladding a hull with
 * slabs armours its deck and its keel and leaves every side bare. A ship has six sides and is mostly
 * sides. So plating carries the direction it was applied in, sits against that face, and can be put on
 * a wall, a ceiling or a floor with the same block and no variants to choose between.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What the facing does NOT change</h3>
 * <p>Nothing about armour. What decides whether a body meets structure is whether the VOXEL holds a
 * block, never what shape it holds — {@code StructureDamageEngine.isStructure} reads air and liquid and
 * nothing else. So a coating on a wall answers a contact exactly as one on a floor does, and layering
 * is layering because the layers are neighbouring voxels along the body's path, never because two of
 * them share one. The facing is where it LOOKS and where you can walk; the armour is the voxel.</p>
