/**
 * The air-intake duct: bolted to a chiller's cold face, it makes the machine draw from the room
 * instead of from a coolant loop.
 * <p>
 * Deliberately NOT a {@link BlockHeatLoop}. Plumbing joins the heat graph and carries thermal mass;
 * this joins nothing and stores nothing — it is a mouth, and all it does is say which zone is on the
 * other side of it. Making it a loop block would additionally weld it to whatever pipe it touched,
 * which is exactly the merge a chiller exists to prevent.
