/**
 * Mirror plating — glass with a thin film of metal behind it, and what that means when shot at.
 *
 * <h3>It is a coating, not a wall</h3>
 * <p>A mirror is a surface you apply to a hull, so it clings to whichever face it was put on — see
 * {@link BlockPlating}. A ship is mostly SIDES, and armour you can only lay on a deck is armour for
 * one sixth of a ship.</p>
 *
 * <h3>It reflects a FRACTION, and dies by the rest</h3>
 * <p>No mirror returns everything. What it does not return is absorbed by the film behind the glass,
 * and a film is thin: past some amount of absorbed energy the metal melts and the plate stops being an
 * optic at all. The law is the physics, with nothing invented:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   reflected = R x E            -&gt; sent back out along the mirrored direction
 *   absorbed  = (1 - R) x E      -&gt; stays in the film
 *   absorbed &gt; dissipation       -&gt; the plating is GONE, in one hit, and reflects nothing again
 * </pre>
 * <p>Two things follow without another rule being written. A better mirror survives more hits, because
 * it absorbs less of each. And there is no such thing as a half-working mirror: an optic either is one
 * or is not, which is why this does not degrade through stages the way a hull plate does.</p>
 *
 * <h3>It does nothing special about a slug</h3>
 * <p>Glass and foil. A solid body is not reflected: the plating declines, and the default law breaks it
 * like any other pane at the price its table row sets. The kind carried by the contact is the only thing
 * separating that case from the one above, which is exactly what the contact seam exists to make
 * expressible.</p>
