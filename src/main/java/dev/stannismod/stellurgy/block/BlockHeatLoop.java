/**
 * What a coolant pipe and a heat accumulator have in common as BLOCKS: they are plumbing, and they
 * are the only thing in the world that notices when the machine they are cooling appears or goes.
 * <p>
 * That second job needs saying. A machine is not part of the heat network — it is read from beside
 * it — so placing a reactor against a finished pipe marks nothing dirty and the loop would go on
 * cooling a machine that is not there, or ignoring one that is. Vanilla already tells a block when
 * its neighbours change, whichever way they were placed, so the signal costs nothing and covers
 * every placer rather than only a player's hand.
