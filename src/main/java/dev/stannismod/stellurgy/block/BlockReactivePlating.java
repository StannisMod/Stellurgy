/**
 * Reactive plating — a charge that spends ITSELF to eat part of a hit, and takes nothing else with it.
 *
 * <h3>Local, and directed away</h3>
 * <p>It is made of much what an explosive is, arranged differently, and it detonates only where it
 * stands: outward, into the thing that struck it, never into the hull it is bolted to or the plate
 * beside it. That is the whole reason a charge is a sane thing to clad a ship in — the alternative is
 * armour that finishes the enemy's work.</p>
 *
 * <h3>It eats a PORTION, and the portion is its volume</h3>
 * <p>How much of an impact it swallows is declared per block: heavy plating eats more than light, and
 * two layers eat more than one because the second is asked after the first is gone — layers being
 * neighbouring VOXELS along the body's path, which is the only kind of layering a voxel world has. So
 * the ordering the mechanic exists to produce:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>machine-gun fire, micrometeorites, splinters — swallowed whole, one charge each;</li>
 *   <li>a railgun round — punches through a single layer as if it were not there, because what it
 *       carries dwarfs what one charge can take. Against that the answer is a shield, and reactive
 *       plating is honest about not being one.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>It is spent, not damaged</h3>
 * <p>A charge that has gone off is gone. The block removes itself and the next body through that spot
 * meets whatever was behind it — which is what makes "the second shot is not stopped" a property of
 * the thing rather than a number somebody has to keep.</p>
