/**
 * A ship machine that carries a tile entity but has nothing to say to a player who right-clicks it.

 * <p>The hyperdrive family is deliberately built this way: a generator, a capacitor, an emitter and
 * a dampener have no settings to change and no inventory to fill. What each of them is worth is
 * decided by what the player welded around it, and what the ship as a whole can do is read at the
 * navigation computer — one console, one place to look, instead of a panel on every block.</p>
