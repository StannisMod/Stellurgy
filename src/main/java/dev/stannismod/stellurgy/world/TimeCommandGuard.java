/**
 * Keeps {@code /time set} and {@code /time add} off the worlds whose skip is locked
 * ({@link TimeSkipPolicy}).
 *
 * <p><b>Why the command needs a guard of its own at all.</b> Vanilla's {@code /time} is not a
 * per-world command: {@code CommandTime.setAllWorldTimes} walks {@code server.worlds} and writes
 * every loaded one, so a player standing on the overworld moves every planet's clock with him and a
 * player standing on a planet does the same in reverse. There is no argument to say which world he
 * meant, so the policy has to be applied per world inside the loop — which means replacing the
 * loop.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>It applies, it does not refuse.</b> The command runs and does what it is allowed to do; the
 * worlds it may not touch are left alone and NAMED, in one line. A refusal would be the easier
 * implementation and the worse one: an all-worlds command that fails entirely because one of its
 * targets is locked would be a command a player cannot use at all once he has a base off-world.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code /time query} is read-only and is never intercepted. Neither is a run in which no loaded
 * world is locked — there the vanilla command is exactly right and this handler stands aside, so the
 * common case pays nothing and behaves byte-for-byte as before.</p>
 *
 * <p>Registered on the Forge event bus beside the other world handlers; the interception seam is the
 * same one {@code /weather} already uses.</p>
