/**
 * Whether a world's time of day may be SKIPPED — jumped forward by a bed or by {@code /time} —
 * as opposed to advancing on its own.
 *
 * <p>A planet's day is the turning of a body in an orbit. A bed that fast-forwards it, and a command
 * that sets it to noon everywhere at once, are arcade conveniences that contradict that: they are
 * what Minecraft is, not what a planet is. So they become a choice — kept on the overworld, where a
 * player is still playing Minecraft, and off past it, where he is somewhere that turns at its own
 * rate.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>This governs the SKIPS and nothing else.</b> The natural advance of one tick per tick is
 * untouched: a locked planet still turns, its sun still rises, and its night still ends — you just
 * have to be there when it does.</p>
 *
 * <p>Pure decision surface, deliberately: {@link #allows(boolean, boolean, boolean, boolean)} takes
 * every input as an argument so the whole policy is testable without a world, a server or a config
 * file.</p>
