/**
 * A stand-in for the protection mod nobody wants to install to run a test.
 *
 * <h3>What it exists to prove</h3>
 * <p>Weapon fire removes blocks by asking first — it posts a break event and honours a refusal. That
 * contract is only worth anything if something can actually refuse, and everything that would refuse
 * in production (a claim mod, a region plugin, an admin's listener) is a third party we do not ship.
 * So this registers exactly what one of them registers: an ordinary subscriber to
 * {@code BlockEvent.BreakEvent} that cancels for the positions it was told to guard.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is a listener, not a seam: nothing in the damage engine knows this class exists, and the
 * path a test exercises through it is the same path a stranger's mod takes. Test-only, and reachable
 * only through the {@code /stellurgytest} command, which the mod refuses to register without its test
 * property.</p>
