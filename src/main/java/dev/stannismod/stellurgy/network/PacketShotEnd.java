/**
 * Server&rarr;client: a round stopped here, for this reason.
 *
 * <p>The point matters as much as the fact. A client stepping its own copy of a flight has no way to
 * know a shell absorbed it or a hull stopped it — those are decisions taken in a world the client
 * does not simulate — so without this the round would sail on through the thing it hit, and the
 * player would watch a miss that was actually a kill. The reason travels with it because an impact
 * on a hull and an absorption at a shield want different effects, and deciding which is which from
 * the position alone is guesswork.</p>
