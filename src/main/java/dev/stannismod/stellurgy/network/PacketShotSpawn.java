/**
 * Server&rarr;client: a round has left a muzzle, and here is everything needed to draw its whole
 * flight.
 *
 * <h3>One packet per shot, not one per tick</h3>
 * <p>A shot's path is completely determined by where it started, how fast it was going and what acts
 * on it — the server integrates exactly that and nothing else. So the client is told once and steps
 * its own copy with the same arithmetic, instead of being sent a position twenty times a second for
 * a minute of flight. A round that is deflected or stopped early gets a
 * {@link PacketShotEnd}; until one arrives, the client's copy is right because it is running the
 * same integration on the same numbers.</p>
 *
 * <h3>It is a drawing, and it is honest about that</h3>
 * <p>Nothing the client does with this affects the game: the client has no registry, steps nothing
 * the server reads back, and resolves no hit. A client that never received one of these plays the
 * same game — worse-looking, not different.</p>
