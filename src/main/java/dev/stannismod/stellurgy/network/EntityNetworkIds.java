/**
 * The one owner of this jar's entity spawn-network-id space.
 *
 * <p>A modded entity does not reach a client by registry name. The server writes
 * {@code (modId, per-mod network id)} into the spawn message and the client resolves that pair back
 * to a class by taking the FIRST registration under that mod carrying the id -- an insertion-ordered
 * scan with no uniqueness check anywhere in Forge. The id space is therefore scoped to the MOD
 * CONTAINER, and this jar hosts three code bases inside one container: this mod, the vendored shield
 * mod and the vendored physics engine. Two of them picking the same number is not rejected: the
 * loser is built as the winner's class and then fed the sender's data-watcher entries by slot index,
 * and the first read of a wrongly-typed slot takes the client down -- in a different class, on a
 * later tick, with nothing pointing back at the registration that caused it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why a declared space and not a counter.</b> A counter is not what makes this safe. The
 * physics engine's registration already used one and restarted it at zero in a space it did not own;
 * that is exactly what collided, and because no number appeared at the call site there was nothing
 * to check the host's list against. Worse, a call-order counter makes the id depend on execution
 * order, so the day one registration becomes conditional -- side-only, config-gated, gated on another
 * mod -- the two sides allocate differently and every packet decodes as the wrong entity, just as
 * silently. Here the space is DECLARED: the index of a name in {@link #SPACE} is its id, no call
 * site carries a number, and an entity that is not declared cannot be registered at all.</p>
 *
 * <p>Adding an entity: append its name to the end of {@link #SPACE}. Never reorder, never insert in
 * the middle, never reuse a removed slot -- a retired entry stays where it is (its number stays
 * burned) so no id ever changes meaning. The ids are runtime-only: NBT and the registry use names,
 * and both sides of a connection are this same jar, so appending is wire-safe.</p>
 *
 * Every static field of this type is effectively final, process lifetime: built once at class initialisation.
