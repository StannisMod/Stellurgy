/**
 * The one owner of this mod's packet discriminators.
 *
 * <p>A packet travels as a number, not as a class name: the channel's codec keeps id->class and
 * class->id side by side and validates neither, so registering two classes on one id leaves encode
 * writing the same number for both while decode hands every one of them back as whichever was
 * registered last. The receiver then reads a foreign packet's fields as its own -- the same silent
 * shape as a duplicate entity spawn id, on a different space.</p>
 *
 * <p>The discriminator is allocated by the channel in registration order, so the ORDER of
 * {@link #PACKETS} is the wire format. Declaring the whole space as one list keeps that order in a
 * single reviewable place, makes a duplicate impossible to miss, and keeps registration
 * unconditional -- a registration hidden behind a side or config check would allocate different
 * numbers on the two sides and mis-decode everything after it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Adding a packet: append it to the end. Never insert in the middle and never reorder -- both
 * renumber every packet after the edit, and while that is harmless when both sides are this same jar,
 * it makes the list useless as a record of what shipped.</p>
