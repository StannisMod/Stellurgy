 * Server&rarr;client baseline for the space clock — one {@code long}, the value

 *
 * <p>Sent to each player at login and re-sent periodically thereafter. The client does not need one
 * of these per tick: it advances its own copy and uses the re-sends only to bound drift (see
 * {@link SpaceClockSync}).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Cadence, stated as the PEAK rather than the average</b>: the periodic re-send gives each
 * player his own phase inside the interval, derived from his own id, so the cost is at most ONE
 * packet in any tick regardless of how many players are online — not "every player once per
 * interval", which would be every player in the SAME tick. The sender is
 * {@code SpaceEventHandler.onServerTick}.</p>
