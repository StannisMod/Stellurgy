/**
 * Server -> client: capture the recipient (a just-dismounted pilot) in his ship's frame, standing on a
 * DECK point expressed in the ship's own SUBSPACE.
 *
 * <p>Crew movement is client-authoritative, so the capture that actually holds a body must live on the
 * client's own player object; the server can only ask for it. A server-side capture (or a server
 * teleport onto the deck) instead moves the client body, which {@link ShipFrameTravel}'s ~1&nbsp;mm
 * external-move guard reads as "someone else moved it" and drops the capture. The deck point therefore
 * travels as a SUBSPACE triple, never a world position: the client maps it to world through its OWN ship
 * transform, snaps there and stores that same world value, so its position and its stored anchor match
 * exactly and the guard holds. A world position computed on the server would differ here by more than the
 * guard and drop instantly. Re-sent across the short dismount window; a no-op once the capture has
 * taken.</p>
