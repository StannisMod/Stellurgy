/**
 * Server&rarr;client: a gun's beam is burning between these two points, or it has gone out.
 *
 * <h3>One packet for a state, not for an event</h3>
 * <p>A beam has no launch and no impact to announce — it is a line that exists while a trigger is
 * held, so what travels is the line itself. The gun's own position is the key: a gun holds at most
 * one beam, which makes "this gun's beam" the whole identity and saves inventing ids for something
 * with no lifetime worth naming.</p>
 *
 * <p>The endpoints are written only when it is lit. Going out is the common case for the smaller
 * packet, and a client being told "not burning" has no use for coordinates.</p>
 *
 * <h3>It is a drawing, and it is honest about that</h3>
 * <p>Nothing the client does with this affects the game: no damage is resolved from it, nothing
 * reads it back, and a player who received none of them plays the same game — worse-looking, not
 * different.</p>

     * straight through the very plating that turned it. The cap is a wire bound and matches the
     * server's own segment budget, so a path that reaches it is drawn as far as it was resolved.</p>
