/**
 * What one stage of repair costs, in materials, and whether a player is carrying it.
 *
 * <h3>The price is the block's own recipe, scaled</h3>
 * <p>A repair is a partial rebuild, so it is priced out of what building the thing costs: the
 * ingredients of the block's crafting recipe times a per-stage fraction. That keeps repair inside the
 * material economy the ship already runs on rather than inventing a currency for it, and it scales
 * with the block automatically — a hull plate is cheap to weld and a machine is not, without anybody
 * writing a second table.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What it deliberately does NOT promise</h3>
 * <p>That welding is always the cheap option. For a plain, cheaply-crafted block, breaking it and
 * placing a fresh one is a repair too, and often a cheaper one — that is a legitimate outcome, not a
 * balance failure. Welding buys something replacement cannot: the block, and everything its tile
 * entity is holding, stays where it is. Replacing a machine to fix a crack empties it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Blocks with no recipe</h3>
 * <p>Stone, ore, and anything else that is gathered rather than crafted has no ingredient list to
 * price against, and this refuses them rather than inventing a cost. The caller reports that as its
 * own outcome; it is not a silent no-op.</p>

     * stage: a repair is never free. Where several recipes make the same block the first registered
     * one wins, which is arbitrary but stable; a block whose recipes differ wildly in cost would need
     * a rule of its own, and none does today.</p>
