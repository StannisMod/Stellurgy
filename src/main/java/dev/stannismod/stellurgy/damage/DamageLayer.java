/**
 * The damage a captured structure carries with it: the stages and destruction provenance of its
 * plain blocks, expressed as offsets from the capture box rather than as world coordinates.
 *
 * <h3>Why this exists at all</h3>
 * <p>A block's stage lives in one of two homes — a tile entity that can hold its own wear, or the
 * per-world {@link BlockDamageSavedData} for everything else. The tile half already travels: a
 * relocation copies tile NBT verbatim. The other half does not, because it is keyed by position in
 * the world the blocks occupy, and a relocated structure is re-pasted at fresh coordinates. Without
 * this layer a ship that jumps arrives pristine — a free repair for the price of a jump.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why the damage is NOT hung on a block</h3>
 * <p>Handing the whole map to one tile's NBT (the flight computer, say) would make it travel for
 * free, and would also make a single breakable block the custodian of every other block's state:
 * mine that block, put it back, and the hull is whole again. Damage is a property of the structure,
 * so it moves through the channel the structure itself moves through and no block owns it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Frame</h3>
 * <p>Offsets are relative to the minimum corner of the box that was captured — the same origin the
 * block array and the tile coordinates use — so the layer survives being pasted anywhere, in any
 * world, exactly as the blocks do. It deliberately carries destroyed positions too (air in the
 * snapshot, provenance in the entry), or a rebuild at the far end would have nothing to put back.</p>

     * <p>The two are given separately because they are genuinely different boxes, and conflating them
     * silently drops damage. A capture's origin is its tight block bounds — that is where the blocks
     * will be laid down again — but those bounds are computed from blocks that still EXIST, and the
     * interesting records are exactly the positions whose block does not. Shoot the outermost column
     * of a hull away and the tight bounds shrink inside it, leaving that column's records outside a
     * box drawn from them, while the cut that follows still clears the wider region. Selection must
     * therefore cover everything the caller is about to empty; an offset outside the block volume is
     * legitimate, and negative components are expected.</p>
