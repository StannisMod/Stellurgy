 * The one entry point for damaging structure. A weapon, a hazard or a collision declares an impact
 * here and reads back what happened; it names no block, no stage and no toughness, and it is told no
 * decision — only facts it can decide from.
 *
 * <h3>One call for a ship and for a building</h3>
 * <p>The call takes a WORLD and a point, never a ship id. Nearly every ship system has to work on a
 * planetary base as well, and ground batteries have to be able to engage ships; if the caller had to
 * know which kind of thing it was shooting at, every weapon would grow two code paths that drift
 * apart. So this service resolves the target itself: a ship whose blocks actually occupy the impact
 * point, or, when there is none, the ordinary blocks of that world.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Frames</h3>
 * <p>Callers work in the world frame. Ship blocks do not live there — they live at fixed addresses in
 * a shipyard subspace while the ship flies around — so the point and the direction are mapped into
 * that frame here, once, and the report's points are mapped back. No caller and no engine below sees
 * two frames.</p>
