     * ablation columns are the same law with different constants. A voxel is one cubic metre only when
     * something fills it, and until this was asked a glass pane cost a solid block of glass to shoot
     * through, a carpet cost a block of wool, and a coating filling an eighth of its voxel was eight
     * times dearer to bore than the physics says. Every hull the tests fire at is built of full cubes,
     * which is precisely the shape that hides it.</p>
     *
     * <h3>Why the collision LIST and not the bounding box</h3>
     * <p>A bounding box is one box, so a shape made of several can only be summarised by it — and
     * vanilla proves the point twice over: {@code BlockStairs} does not override {@code getBoundingBox}
     * at all and reports a full cube, while {@code BlockFence} reports the envelope of its post and
     * arms, which is mostly air. Both over-state, one enormously. The collision list is where a block
     * states its real shape, box by box, so that is what is summed. Overlapping boxes would double
     * count, which is why the sum is clamped: over-counting can only ever produce "a full cube", the
     * answer we started from.</p>
     *
     * <h3>There is no floor under it, and nothing is free anyway</h3>
     * <p>A floor was tried and removed: it was a MULTIPLIER, so it priced "the least a block can cost"
     * out of that block's own material, and what it was meant to represent — the work of breaking a
     * thing off its mounting — has nothing to do with what the thing is made of. What actually keeps a
     * near-empty voxel from being free is {@code STAGE_COST_BASE}, which is material-independent and
     * already inside the product: a standing torch answers 0.024 here and still costs 6 against the
     * 1000 a full block of stone costs. Below that the price itself floors at 1.</p>
     *
     * <p>The floor's stated reason — that a torch must not be a hole in a hull — does not survive
     * being looked at: a voxel holding a torch is a voxel holding no hull block. The hole is the
     * builder's, and pricing it dearly does not fill it.</p>
