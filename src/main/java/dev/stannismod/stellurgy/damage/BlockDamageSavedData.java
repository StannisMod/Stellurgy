/**
 * Damage stages of blocks that cannot hold their own, stored per world.
 *
 * <p>A tile entity able to carry a wear stage keeps it, as it always has. Everything else — plain
 * hull, plating, a wall — has nowhere to put a stage, and giving every damaged block a tile entity is
 * not available: vanilla stores a tile only when the block itself declares one, so an injected tile is
 * dropped on the floor. Hence this map.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Shape</h3>
 * <p>Keyed by the packed {@link BlockPos} long, because the access pattern that matters is a turret
 * burst: many cheap reads against blocks that are mostly pristine. A miss must therefore cost nothing,
 * which is why nothing here builds an object to answer "no damage".</p>
 *
 * <h3>Provenance</h3>
 * <p>When a block is destroyed its original state is recorded, so a repair can put back what was
 * there rather than a guess. It is stored as a registry name plus metadata rather than a numeric
 * state id: ids are an install-local encoding and a save that outlives one registry order would
 * otherwise rebuild a hull out of whatever now occupies that number.</p>
 *
 * <h3>This store is per WORLD, and a structure can leave its world</h3>
 * <p>Entries are keyed by position in the world the blocks currently occupy, so they are stable for
 * as long as the blocks are: a ship moves by transform, not by moving its blocks. A structure that is
 * relocated IS re-pasted at fresh coordinates, and there the entries are carried by
 * {@link DamageLayer} — harvested into the capture, expressed as offsets, and replayed at the far
 * end. No block owns the map, so no block can be broken to reset it.</p>
