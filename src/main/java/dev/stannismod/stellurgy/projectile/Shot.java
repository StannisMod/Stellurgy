/**
 * A shot in flight — a record in a registry, deliberately <b>not</b> an entity.
 *
 * <h3>Why not an entity</h3>
 * <p>An entity is only simulated where the world is loaded and only tracked near a player. A round
 * that has to cross kilometres therefore has two futures as an entity, and both are wrong: it dies
 * quietly the moment it leaves the shooter's bubble, which makes long-range fire a lie, or the server
 * keeps a corridor of world loaded along every trajectory, which makes firing an attack on the host.
 * A record is simulated by its world's own tick regardless of who is watching, and costs three
 * vectors.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Which frame its position is in — and why that is not always the world's</h3>
 * <p>A free-flying shot is expressed in world coordinates. A shot that is <em>inside somebody's
 * material</em> is expressed in that hull's own subspace frame instead ({@link #getHullId()}), because
 * a hull is a thing that manoeuvres: a round stored in world coordinates would be left behind by a
 * ship that moved between two ticks and would resume the next tick outside the plate it was drilling,
 * or inside a plate that had sailed on. Riding the hull's frame makes boring through a hard-turning
 * ship and boring through a parked one the same arithmetic.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Mutable, and owned by exactly one thing</h3>
 * <p>Position, velocity, age and the remaining impact energy change every tick; everything else is
 * fixed at the muzzle. The record is owned by the {@link ShotRegistry} of one world and is mutated
 * only by {@link ShotSubstrate} while stepping it — server side. A client never simulates a shot: it
 * would be describing a different flight from the one that is going to hit somebody.</p>
