/**
 * Which layer a straight segment meets FIRST — the field or a structure — and how far along.
 *
 * <h3>Why this is a class and not four lines inside a step</h3>
 * <p>It was four lines inside {@link ShotSubstrate}, and it stayed correct only while exactly one
 * thing in the game asked the question. A held beam asks it too, and a second copy of "which layer
 * wins" is a second answer: a weapon that resolved the ordering one way while the substrate resolved
 * it the other would fire through its own shield, or into a shell it had decided was not there, for
 * reasons no reproduction would find.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Ordering is geometric, never a pipeline</h3>
 * <p>"Shield first, then hull" is a rule that is wrong whenever the geometry says otherwise: a body
 * emitted from INSIDE a shell meets the hull with no shield in between, and one crossing a friendly
 * bubble on its way elsewhere should not be billed to it. So both layers are asked where they would be
 * crossed, in blocks along this segment, and the smaller distance wins. The field answers {@code -1}
 * for a ray that starts inside a shell, which is that same statement in its own vocabulary.</p>
