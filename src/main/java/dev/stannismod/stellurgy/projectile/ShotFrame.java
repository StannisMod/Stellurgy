/**
 * The one place a shot changes coordinate frames.
 *
 * <h3>Why a shot has a frame at all</h3>
 * <p>A hull manoeuvres. A round drilling through one is inside a moving thing, and a position in
 * world coordinates describes where that thing <em>used to be</em>: one tick later the plate has gone
 * somewhere else and the round is either hanging in the hole's wake or buried in a part of the ship
 * it never reached. So a shot inside material is kept in that hull's own subspace, where a round
 * standing still against the plate does not drift — the same discipline every other aboard body here
 * already follows.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What is converted, and what is not</h3>
 * <p>Position converts through the full transform; velocity through the rotation ALONE plus the
 * hull's own motion at that point. The two halves matter separately: the rotation is what makes a
 * relative velocity comparable with subspace faces, and the hull's motion is what a round keeps when
 * it comes out the far side — a round that punched through a ship doing forty blocks a second and
 * left with only its drilling speed would have been robbed by the bookkeeping.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Every conversion may fail, and failure means "stay where you are"</h3>
 * <p>VS answers null for a ship that has unloaded or was never registered. A half-converted shot is
 * worse than an unconverted one, so each entry point either performs the whole change or performs
 * none of it and says so.</p>
