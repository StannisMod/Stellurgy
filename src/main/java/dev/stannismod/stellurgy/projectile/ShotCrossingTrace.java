/**
 * What a shot's step DECIDED, tick by tick — a recorder, not a mechanism.
 *
 * <h3>Why this exists</h3>
 * <p>A round that crosses a wall spending nothing and a round whose impact was refused look exactly
 * the same from outside: the wall is unmarked and the budget is whole either way. The difference is
 * a single comparison inside the step — which layer answered a distance, and which one won — and
 * nothing above that comparison can see it. So the comparison says so itself, and the question stops
 * being a matter of inference.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Off unless the harness is running</h3>
 * <p>Every entry point is gated on {@link TestProbeCommandRegistration#isTestMode()}, the same flag
 * the {@code /stellurgytest} surface is registered under. In an ordinary game this class records nothing and
 * costs one boolean read per crossing.</p>
 *
 * <h3>It LEAKS across scenarios, and that is stated rather than hidden</h3>
 * <p>The ring is a single-writer diagnostic with no owner: it is written by the world tick, it
 * outlives any one test, and on a shared server it carries entries from whatever ran before. It
 * decides nothing — no production branch reads it — but a reader who forgets that will attribute
 * somebody else's round to their own. {@link #reset()} is how a scenario claims a clean instrument,
 * and every read reports {@code dropped} so a truncated history cannot pass for a quiet one.</p>
