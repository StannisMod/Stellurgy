/**
 * Who gets told that a beam is burning, and how often.
 *
 * <h3>A held thing is told by STATE, not by events</h3>
 * <p>A round is announced twice in a whole flight because its path is determined by the numbers in
 * the first packet. A beam has no such determinism: it is wherever its gun is pointing THIS tick, it
 * can end on a wall that was not there a second ago, and it stops the instant the trigger is released
 * or the feed runs dry. So what is replicated is its current segment, and the client holds that
 * segment until it is told otherwise or until it goes stale.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Sent when it changed, and repeated so it cannot get stuck</h3>
 * <p>Sending every tick would put twenty packets a second per lit beam on every nearby connection for
 * a picture that mostly does not change; sending only on change would leave a beam drawn forever on
 * the client of a player whose "it went out" packet never arrived — because the gun was blown up, the
 * chunk unloaded, or they were out of range at the moment it stopped. So both: a packet whenever the
 * segment moves or the light goes on or off, plus a heartbeat every {@link #REFRESH_TICKS} ticks
 * while it burns. The client drops a beam it has not heard about for a while, which is what makes the
 * heartbeat the thing keeping it alive rather than a decoration.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Peak, not average</b>: a beam whose aim is moving costs one packet per nearby player per
 * tick; one held steady on a spot costs one per nearby player per {@link #REFRESH_TICKS} ticks. The
 * heartbeats of different guns are spread by a phase taken from each gun's own position, so a
 * broadside that lit on the same tick does not pulse on the same tick forever.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The channel belongs to the gun</h3>
 * <p>There is no registry of live beams and no static map keyed by position: a beam's owner is the
 * gun holding it — the emission has no existence apart from that — so the little state this needs,
 * namely what the client was last told, lives in a {@link Channel} the gun keeps. A gun that unloads
 * takes its channel with it, which is exactly the lifetime a beam has.</p>
