/**
 * What a shot does between muzzle and impact. Fire one with {@link #launch}; everything after that
 * happens in this world's own tick, whether or not anybody is watching.
 *
 * <h3>The layer this owns, and the two it does not</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Here</b>: what a shot IS while it travels — a record, its integration, and which layer it
 *       meets FIRST. That last one is this class's real content.</li>
 *   <li><b>The field layer</b> (the shield's strike seam) owns what a shell does to a body that
 *       reaches it: how much it absorbs, and where a mirrored body goes. This class hands a strike
 *       over and reads the answer; it never computes a deflection or spends shield energy itself.</li>
 *   <li><b>The structure layer</b> owns what an impact does to blocks, and the BLOCK it met owns
 *       what happens to the body: this class asks (through {@link ContactResolver}) and obeys the
 *       answer. It still names no stage and no ship, and it never decides a deflection itself.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Ordering is geometric, not a pipeline</h3>
 * <p>Shield first, then hull, would be a rule that is wrong whenever the geometry says otherwise — a
 * shot fired from <em>inside</em> a shell meets the hull with no shield in between, and a shot that
 * passes a friendly bubble on the way to its target should not be billed to it. So every layer is
 * asked where it would be crossed, in blocks along this tick's segment, and the smallest distance
 * wins. The field layer answers {@code -1} for a ray that starts inside a shell, which is the same
 * statement in its own vocabulary.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Server only</h3>
 * <p>A client that simulated shots would be describing a different flight from the one about to hit
 * somebody. It is told about shots; it never steps one.</p>
