/**
 * One tick of a beam somebody is HOLDING on a target.
 *
 * <h3>A beam is not a shot, and the difference is what this class is</h3>
 * <p>A shot is a body with a budget: it is admitted once, it travels, and it spends what it was given
 * until it has none left. A beam has no budget and no flight — it is a LINE with a power, re-resolved
 * every tick for as long as the gun holds it, and its depth grows with dwell rather than being carried
 * in. So there is no record in the shot registry: a thing that does not travel has no flight to step,
 * and there is nothing to persist, because a beam's lifetime is exactly as long as its gun is lit.</p>
 *
 * <p>What is NOT different: everything below the muzzle. The same layer ordering decides what the line
 * meets first, the same shield seam prices what reaches a shell, and the same contact seam asks the
 * block what happens. A beam that grew a damage path of its own would be a weapon that armour does not
 * answer, and armour serving one weapon family is armour that will be wrong for the next.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Per tick, because a player has to be able to see it work</h3>
 * <p>The energy of ONE tick is declared each tick. Against a shell that is a rate against a reserve —
 * a beam the shell can pay for is held off, and one it cannot pay for gets through, which is what
 * makes a shield something to survive behind rather than something to sit behind. Against a hull it is
 * a small budget applied to the same walk over and over, so the hole deepens for as long as the trigger
 * is held.</p>
