/**
 * Who gets told about a round, and who does not.
 *
 * <h3>Told once, and only if it goes past you</h3>
 * <p>A shot is a server record; a client can only draw one it was told about. Telling everybody
 * about every round would put a battery's whole rate of fire on every connection in the world,
 * including players on the far side of a planet who will never see it — so the test is geometric:
 * a player is told when the round's PATH passes within {@code shotVisibilityRadius} of them, not
 * when its muzzle does. That is what makes a round fired from four kilometres away visible to the
 * person it is fired AT, which is the case that matters most and the one a muzzle-distance filter
 * gets exactly backwards.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Two packets for a minute of flight</h3>
 * <p>The path is determined by the numbers in the first packet, so there is no per-tick stream: the
 * client integrates its own copy and is corrected once, at the end. A player who came into range
 * mid-flight sees nothing — a gap that costs one missed tracer and saves a per-tick proximity scan
 * of every player against every round in the air.</p>
