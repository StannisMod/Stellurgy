/**
 * Tell the players who could actually see a thing about it, and nobody else.

 * <h3>Geometry, not a subscription</h3>
 * <p>Weapon fire is server state with no entity and no chunk behind it, so a client draws only what
 * it was told about. Telling everybody would put a battery's whole rate of fire on every connection
 * in the world, including players on the far side of a planet; the test is therefore how near the
 * player is to the LINE the thing occupies — a round's forward path, a beam's lit length — rather
 * than to its origin. A muzzle-distance filter gets the case that matters most exactly backwards:
 * the person being shot at from four kilometres away is the one who most needs to see it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Built once, sent many times</h3>
 * <p>The packet is a {@link Supplier} because most calls tell nobody: in an empty region the loop
 * runs and nothing is ever constructed. It is built on the first player who passes the test and
 * reused for the rest.</p>
