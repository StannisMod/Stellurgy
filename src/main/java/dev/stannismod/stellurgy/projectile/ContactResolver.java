 * <h3>Why this lives in the shot's layer and not in the damage engine</h3>
 * <p>A contact is a fact about a travelling body — how fast, how wide, at what angle — and the damage
 * engine is deliberately ignorant of all three: it is also driven by explosions and collisions, which
 * have none of them. So the body's own layer resolves the meeting, and only what the answer says was
 * absorbed goes to the engine, through the door that already existed.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The default law reproduces what the game did before there was a contract</h3>
 * <p>A block that says nothing gets the behaviour it always had: the impact is declared against
 * structure with the shot's full energy and the shot ends there. That is the property this layer can
 * be held to before any armour exists — if the plain-hull tests move, the seam was built wrong,
 * whatever the armour does later.</p>
