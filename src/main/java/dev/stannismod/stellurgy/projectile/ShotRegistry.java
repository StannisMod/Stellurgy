/**
 * Every shot in flight in one world, and the only thing that owns one.

 * <h3>Per world, and that is the whole of the isolation</h3>
 * <p>Two shots in different worlds cannot interact, and they cannot because they are held by two
 * different objects with no reference to each other — not because anything compares dimension ids on
 * the way past. A shot fired in a space cell and a shot fired on a planet are stepped by their own
 * world's tick, tested against their own world's blocks, and stored in their own world's save.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why a WorldSavedData</h3>
 * <p>The state needs an owner whose lifetime is the world's: attached when the world loads, written
 * when it saves, gone when it unloads. A static map keyed by dimension would be all three of the
 * things that make a static a defect — mutable, depended upon, and written by more than one place —
 * and would additionally lose every round in flight across a restart, which for a weapon with a
 * minute of flight time is a visible lie rather than a technicality.</p>
