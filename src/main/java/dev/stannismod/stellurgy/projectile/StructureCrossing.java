/**
 * Where along a swept segment the first solid thing is — and nothing about what happens next.
 *
 * <h3>Two places blocks live, one answer</h3>
 * <p>A world's own blocks sit in the world frame. A ship's blocks do not: they stay at fixed
 * addresses in a shipyard subspace while the ship flies elsewhere, so a traversal of the world frame
 * finds nothing where a hull visibly is. Both are searched here and the earlier crossing wins, which
 * is what lets everything above this class hold a single question — "what did I hit first" — instead
 * of a branch on target class.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The ship segment is transformed, not sampled</h3>
 * <p>A ship's transform is rigid, so a straight world segment is a straight subspace segment: both
 * endpoints are mapped and the same exact traversal runs there. Sampling the world segment and asking
 * "is there a ship block under this point" would reintroduce, one layer up, the skipping that the
 * traversal exists to remove.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What this does NOT see — stage 1</h3>
 * <p>An unloaded region. A voxel whose chunk is not loaded is <b>skipped</b>, not treated as solid and
 * not treated as empty — nobody looked. That is honest only because stage 1 fires in the band ships
 * fly in, where there are no world blocks at all; on a planet it means a shot crosses unloaded terrain
 * untouched. Closing it is stage 2's conservative occupancy summary, and until that lands this
 * limitation is the reason a ground battery is not yet a shipped feature.</p>
