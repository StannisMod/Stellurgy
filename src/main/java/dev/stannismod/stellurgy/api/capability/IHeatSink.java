 * A machine that TAKES heat off a coolant loop and puts it somewhere that is not the loop.

 * asks how much this machine wants and then hands over what it can, so a sink standing between two
 * loops is fed by both instead of being counted twice. The loop decides how much moves, never the
 * machine - the same asymmetry a radiator lives under, and for the same reason.</p>
 *
 * <p>A capability rather than a plain interface for the reason the emitter is one: the machines this
 * system exists to serve mostly belong to other mods, and a mod that wants to soak a ship's heat
 * into something of its own can be given this without either side importing the other.</p>
