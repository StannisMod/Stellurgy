/**
 * Everything a weapon states when it fires, and nothing about the weapon. The muzzle declares where
 * the round starts, how fast it is going, how much it is worth on arrival and how long it may live;
 * the substrate decides nothing about any of that and the weapon decides nothing about what happens
 * when it lands.
 *
 * <h3>Frames and units</h3>
 * <p>{@link #getOrigin()} and {@link #getVelocity()} are <b>world</b> coordinates, and velocity is in
 * blocks per <b>tick</b> — the unit the integration steps in, so that no call site is left converting
 * from blocks per second and getting it wrong by a factor of twenty. {@link #getImpactEnergy()} is in
 * the same unit as a shield's impact energy and a damage budget, which is what lets a shell hand its
 * residual straight through with no conversion in between.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Owner and faction are tokens, not permissions</h3>
 * <p>The substrate never asks either one a question. They travel with the shot so that the layers
 * which do care — friend-or-foe at the turret, attribution at the impact — have something to read;
 * a shot does not decline to hit its owner, because deciding that is not the substrate's job.</p>
