 * What acts on a shot between one tick and the next — the whole of the physics a travelling round is
 * subject to, declared at the muzzle rather than looked up mid-flight.
 *
 * <p>It is declared because a shot outlives the loaded state of the place it is crossing. Asking the
 * world "what is the gravity here" every tick would mean the answer changes when a region unloads,
 * and a round that curves differently depending on whether anybody happens to be watching is not a
 * round anybody can aim. So the shooter states the environment once and the shot carries it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Only gravity is modelled. Drag is not, and no field is reserved for it: a shot that needs air
 * resistance needs a decision about what "air" means at 2000 blocks up, and that decision is not
 * made yet.</p>
