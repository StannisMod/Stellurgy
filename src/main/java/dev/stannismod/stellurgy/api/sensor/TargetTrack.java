/**
 * One contact, as a sensor currently holds it: where it is, where it is going, and how well it is
 * being held.
 *
 * <h3>Position AND velocity, because a point cannot be led</h3>
 * <p>A gun handed a point misses a moving target by however far it moves while the round is in the
 * air. That is not a gun problem — a gun has no way to know a target is moving — so the velocity
 * travels with the contact, and the mount that consumes it works out the intercept using its own
 * muzzle speed.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Quality is not confidence</h3>
 * <p>{@link #getQuality()} is how well the target is RESOLVED, on 0..1. It is what separates
 * "something is out there" from "I can put a round on it": below the installation's lock threshold a
 * battery may track a contact all day and still not fire at it. Where the number comes from depends
 * on the mode that produced it — the target's own radiance when listening, the sensor's own
 * illumination when lit.</p>
 *
 * <p>Immutable. A track is a snapshot of a moment, not a handle onto a target that keeps changing
 * underneath its reader.</p>
