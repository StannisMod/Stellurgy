/**
 * The moment a tier-2 craft becomes — or stops being — a ship the physics engine has named.
 *
 * <h2>Why an event when a predicate already exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>Asking "is this craft named right now" is the right question for a machine deciding whether to
 * do its work this tick, and it is enough for every such gate. It is not enough for anything that has
 * to happen <b>once, at the moment naming happens</b>: an authoritative recompute of derived state, a
 * registration built at first contact and resolved by id thereafter, a durable record minted at
 * birth. Finding an edge by watching a level means polling, and a subsystem that polls ends up with
 * its own private idea of which tick the craft started existing on. There are enough of those
 * subsystems that each private answer would be a future disagreement about what the craft was when it
 * was born.</p>
 *
 * <h2>What "named" means here</h2>
 *
 * <p>A craft's blocks and its ship object do not arrive together. The blocks are loaded and their
 * tiles tick before the physics engine has a ship for them, and in that window every coordinate they
 * hold is a shipyard address rather than anywhere a player can stand. <b>Named</b> is the later
 * moment: the engine holds a live ship object for this identity, so the craft can be resolved by id,
 * asked for its pose, and written to. That is exactly the level the position-gate answers, and this
 * event is its edge.</p>
 *
 * <h2>The contract — read this before writing a handler</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Server only.</b> Posted from the server's ship manager; nothing posts these on the client,
 *       so a client-side subscriber will simply never fire. A client learns about ships from the
 *       engine's own index packets.</li>
 *   <li><b>The server game thread, inside the world tick.</b> Never the physics thread. A handler may
 *       therefore touch the world, read tiles and send packets, exactly as in any other world-tick
 *       callback. Work that belongs on the physics thread must be handed to it explicitly, the same
 *       way anything else crossing that boundary is.</li>
 *   <li><b>After the fact, and not cancellable.</b> By the time a handler runs, the ship is fully
 *       registered (or fully gone). There is nothing to veto.</li>
 *   <li><b>A handler must not block, and must not throw.</b> It runs inside the tick that every other
 *       ship in the world is waiting on, and Forge's bus re-throws whatever a handler throws — so an
 *       exception here leaves the world tick with nothing between it and the server loop. That is not
 *       special to this event; it is how every Forge event behaves. It is written down because this
 *       one fires from inside the ship manager, where the blast radius is the whole server rather
 *       than one feature, so a handler that can fail catches its own failure and logs it.</li>
 *   <li><b>A handler may queue ship spawns, loads and unloads.</b> These events are published after
 *       the manager has finished draining its queues for the tick, so a queue touched by a handler is
 *       acted on next tick rather than corrupting the drain in progress. This is the reason the
 *       publication is deferred to the end of the pass instead of being posted at each site.</li>
 *   <li><b>Ordering within a tick is the order the transitions happened</b> — deregistrations from the
 *       destroy pass, then spawns, then loads, then unloads. A craft that is re-registered in one tick
 *       (a crossing that lands where its own blockless remnant still sat) therefore produces the
 *       {@link Cause#DESTROYED} before the {@link Cause#PASTED}, which is the truth of what
 *       happened.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Named is not the same as simulated</h2>
 *
 * <p>A ship can be named and still not be integrated: the engine only steps a body whose physics has
 * been switched on, and a craft nobody has flown has not switched it on. A handler that arms on this
 * event and then waits for the craft to MOVE may wait forever, and that is not a fault in the
 * event.</p>
