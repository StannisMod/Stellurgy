 * A block that is worth something when it is part of a gun.
 *
 * <h3>Implemented by the BLOCK, deliberately</h3>
 * <p>Parts have no state of their own — a barrel section is a barrel section wherever it is — so
 * asking the block rather than a tile entity means a hundred-block battery costs a hundred block
 * lookups and no tile entities at all. It also means an addon adds a gun part by implementing one
 * interface on a plain block, with nothing to register.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What a part may say</h3>
 * <p>Only what it contributes. A part is never asked whether the gun is complete, never told what
 * else is in the build, and never given the chance to veto: completeness is
 * {@link GunSpec#isOperable()}, decided once, on the sum. That is what keeps a part addable without
 * the parts already there having to agree.</p>
