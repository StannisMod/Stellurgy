/**
 * What a built gun IS, once its parts have been counted: everything the firing code needs and
 * nothing about which blocks produced it.
 *
 * <h3>Derived, never authored per block</h3>
 * <p>A gun's numbers come from its build — how long the barrel is, how much feed and cooling it was
 * given. So this object is produced by walking an assembly, not read off the controller: two guns
 * with the same parts have the same spec wherever they stand, and adding a barrel section is a
 * change a player can measure rather than a change to a config file.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Units are the substrate's units</h3>
 * <p>{@link #getMuzzleSpeed()} is blocks per <b>tick</b> and {@link #getImpactEnergy()} is in the
 * same unit a shield spends and a damage budget carries, because those are the units the shot layer
 * speaks. Nothing downstream converts, so nothing downstream can convert wrongly.</p>
 *
 * <h3>A spec is not permission to fire</h3>
 * <p>It says what a shot would look like; whether one happens is decided by the gun's own energy,
 * heat and drive state. A spec with a zero fire interval would still not fire a gun that is jammed.</p>
