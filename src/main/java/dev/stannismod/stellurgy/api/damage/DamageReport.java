 * What structure did with a declared impact. The report states <em>facts</em> and never a decision:

 * weapon's own business, and it is decidable from these fields.
 *
 * <p>There is deliberately <b>no per-block list</b>. A turret firing continuously produces a stream of
 * small impacts, and a list would be an allocation per shot on the hot path; which particular blocks
 * changed is a surfacing concern and rides the damage map, not the return value.</p>
