/**
 * What just happened to one unit — a cause, a severity and a place, at a moment.
 *
 * <h3>Why this exists beside the stage, which is already there</h3>
 * <p>A stage answers <em>how broken am I</em>: it is durable, it survives a save and a reassembly, and
 * it is PULLED by whoever wants it. It cannot answer <em>what just happened to me</em>, because a
 * shell and a collapsing hyperspace window leave exactly the same stage behind. A cause has no
 * persistent form to pull, so it is pushed once, at the moment it is true, and a unit that was not
 * listening has missed it — which is correct: it is news, not state.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The unit decides; this value decides nothing</h3>
 * <p>Everything here is a FACT about the event. There is no derate in it, no probability, no verdict,
 * because the consequence of being damaged is the unit's own to compute — a damaged engine throttles
 * itself back because it decides to stay safe, not because a table above it lowered a number. This
 * value is what the unit needs in order to decide, and nothing more.</p>
