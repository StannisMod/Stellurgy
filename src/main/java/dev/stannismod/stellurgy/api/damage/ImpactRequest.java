/**
 * One declared impact against structure — everything the damage engine needs and nothing about the
 * thing that produced it. A weapon names no block, no stage and no toughness; the engine names no
 * weapon, no archetype and no trajectory. This object is the whole of what crosses between them.
 *
 * <h3>Frames</h3>
 * <p>{@link #getPoint()} and {@link #getDirection()} are <b>world</b> coordinates. A shot is computed
 * in the world frame, so that is what it hands over; converting into the frame the blocks actually
 * live in happens once, inside the engine, where it can be got right in one place rather than at every
 * call site.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Budget</h3>
 * <p>{@link #getBudget()} is denominated in the same unit as the shield's impact energy, so a shield
 * that is overwhelmed hands its residual straight through as a budget with no conversion factor in
 * between. There is exactly one conversion in the whole chain and it already lives at the muzzle.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Identity</h3>
 * <p>{@link #getImpactId()} identifies this impact for as long as it might be retried. The engine
 * refuses a repeat outright, because the paths that make retries real — an impact resolved later
 * because its region was unloaded, a shot re-examined across a load transition — are exactly the paths
 * where double damage would never show up in a diff. A caller that genuinely wants a second, distinct
 * impact gives it a new id.</p>
