/**
 * The facts a travelling body has when it meets something — and nothing about what is carrying them.
 *
 * <h3>Why the facts and not the record</h3>
 * <p>Armour answers bodies. A shell fired from a gun is one; a bolt is one; a beam somebody is HOLDING
 * on a hull is one too, and it is not a shot in any registry — it has no lifetime, no position that
 * survives a tick and nothing to step. A seam that took the shot record would therefore serve exactly
 * one weapon family, and every later family would arrive with a choice between inventing a fake shot
 * and duplicating the armour behind it. Taking the facts costs one small object per contact and makes
 * armour something the whole game can be built against.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The identity is given, not minted here</h3>
 * <p>{@link #getImpactId()} is what the damage service's duplicate memory keys on, so it must come
 * from whatever owns the body's continuity across ticks: a shot mints one per impact from its own
 * sequence, a held beam mints one per tick it is held. This class does not know how long the thing it
 * describes has existed and must not guess.</p>
