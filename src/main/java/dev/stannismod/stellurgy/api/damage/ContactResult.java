/**
 * What a block answered when a travelling body met it.
 *
 * <h3>Three behaviours, and a way to have none</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #noOpinion} — <b>this block has nothing to say about THIS body</b>, and the default law
 *       applies exactly as if it answered nothing at all. It is not a behaviour, it is a declining to
 *       have one, and it exists because the alternative was to decline by saying
 *       {@code passedThrough(everything)} — which is a real answer meaning "through, for free". A
 *       mirror shipped saying that about slugs and became an armour plate that kinetic fire could
 *       neither pay for nor break.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #passedThrough} — the body carries on, worth less. The default: it is what an ordinary
 *       block does, and what "weakened penetration" means.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #stopped} — nothing continues past this block. <b>Reactive armour is this</b>, plus the
 *       block spending itself; a block that detonates its own charge answers {@code stopped} and takes
 *       care of its own destruction, because what a unit does about its own damage is the unit's
 *       (see the damage-occurrence interface).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #deflected} — the body continues somewhere else. <b>Mirror armour and an angle
 *       ricochet are both this</b>: they differ only in who computed the new velocity — the block's
 *       own law, or the default law from the surface normal and the incidence angle.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Deflection is not a special case a reader has to know about: one that has never heard of mirror
 * armour still reads "the body did not stop here", which stays true. The same discipline the shield's
 * own strike result keeps for its reflection.</p>
