/**
 * One travelling body meeting one block: everything the block needs to decide what it does about it.
 *
 * <h3>Why a block is asked at all</h3>
 * <p>Toughness alone can only make a block expensive. It cannot send a body somewhere else, cannot
 * spend a charge of its own to stop one, and cannot answer a beam differently from a slug — so mirror
 * armour, reactive armour and a ricochet have nowhere to live. A block that is ASKED, and answers with
 * a {@link ContactResult}, has all three.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What is in here and what is deliberately not</h3>
 * <p>The body's own facts (how fast, how wide, how much it still carries, what kind of thing it is)
 * and the geometry of the meeting (where, through which face, at what angle). <b>Not</b> budgets,
 * stages or toughness: those belong to the layer that spends, and a block answering a contact is not
 * spending anything — it is saying what happens.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Frames — the one thing to get right</h3>
 * <p>{@link #getPos()}, {@link #getEntryFace()} and {@link #getVelocity()} are all in the BLOCK's own
 * frame: subspace on a ship, world off one. They travel together on purpose — an incidence angle is
 * an angle between a body and a face, and on a hull that has rotated, a world-frame velocity against
 * a subspace face is not an angle at all, it is two unrelated numbers. {@link #getPoint()} stays
 * WORLD, because that is where the flash goes and what a player saw. {@link #getShipId()} says which
 * case this is rather than leaving it to be inferred from coordinates.</p>
