     * {@code StellurgyConfiguration} reads the flag in mod pre-init, while
     * {@code StellurgyMixinPlugin} must read the same value during the coremod phase,
     * long before that singleton is populated. These are compile-time constants
     * (JLS §13.1), so javac inlines the literal and the coremod never loads this
     * class — but renaming either one now breaks compilation instead of silently
     * leaving the mixin gate stuck open.</p>
