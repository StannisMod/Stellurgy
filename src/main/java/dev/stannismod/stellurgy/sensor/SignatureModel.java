/**
 * How well a thing can be heard, and how well it can be held — the two halves of a signature, kept
 * apart on purpose.
 *
 * <h3>The law</h3>
 * <p>A body radiates {@code σT⁴} watts per square metre of surface. Two consequences, and the whole
 * of this class is them:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Detection range</b> comes from TOTAL radiated power, {@code σT⁴·A}, and grows with its
 *       square root — the ordinary inverse-square falloff read backwards. A big cool object is easy
 *       to notice from far away.</li>
 *   <li><b>Lock quality</b> comes from RADIANCE, {@code σT⁴}, which depends on temperature alone.
 *       A small hot object is a point beacon: it is precisely locatable, however little of it there
 *       is.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>So a compact chiller-boosted array and a large cool one that shed identical watts are entirely
 * different targets, and a player who has understood that has understood the trade this mechanic is
 * made of. Merging the two into one "signature" number would delete it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Where a temperature comes from today</h3>
 * <p>Nowhere, yet: the heat subsystem that will give a hull a radiator temperature is unbuilt. Until
 * it lands, anything that does not state its own signature is ESTIMATED here — a body at roughly
 * living-thing temperature, a burning one at flame temperature, area from its own bounding box. The
 * estimate is deliberately crude and deliberately isolated to one method: the shape of the law is
 * the part that is meant to survive, and when a ship can say how hot it is it says so through
 * {@link ITargetSignature} and none of this is consulted.</p>
