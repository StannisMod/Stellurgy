/**
 * One sweep: everything a sensor can currently hold, in the order it would shoot at them.
 *
 * <h3>Classification happens HERE, not at the trigger</h3>
 * <p>A friend is not something a gun declines to fire at — a friend never becomes a contact in the
 * first place. That is a stronger statement than it looks: a battery cannot be talked into shelling
 * its own crew by a race, a stale target or a console left pointing at the wrong thing, because the
 * name of the friendly was never written down anywhere a gun could read it. The two exclusions are
 * the credential a target carries, and simply being aboard the ship the sensor is bolted to.</p>
 *
 * <h3>World frame, always</h3>
 * <p>Entities live in the world's coordinates and a ship's blocks live in the ship's, so a sensor
 * aboard a hull converts its OWN position out to the world before looking around, and the tracks it
 * produces are in world coordinates. A gun consuming them converts back, once, using the same seam
 * it already uses for every other target.</p>
