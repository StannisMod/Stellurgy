/**
 * Turns raw mouse-look input in the DECK frame for a crew member walking a ship.
 *
 * <p>{@code Entity.turn} adds the mouse delta straight onto world yaw/pitch. While a crew member's
 * movement is resolved aboard a deck his look is held deck-frame instead ({@link DeckLook}): the
 * delta turns the deck yaw/pitch directly - deck-relative by construction at any ship attitude -
 * and the world rotation is derived from it, so this cancels the vanilla world-frame turn. It is
 * inert (returns false) for anyone who is not the local player resolved aboard, so every other
 * {@code turn} runs untouched. Client-only, and references no physics-mod type.</p>
