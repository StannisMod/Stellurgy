/**
 * Stands an aboard entity's rendered model on the deck it is actually standing on.
 *
 * <p>{@code RenderLivingBase.applyRotations} turns a model by its yaw and nothing else, because vanilla
 * has no roll for a body. At its HEAD the modelview has already been translated to the entity's own
 * render origin, so a rotation pushed there turns the whole model about its feet - exactly what a body
 * standing on a tilted deck needs.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two hooks, because the yaw must follow the roll. Once the ship attitude is applied, vanilla's own
 * {@code rotate(180 - rotationYaw)} turns the body about the DECK normal rather than the world's, so
 * the angle it is given has to be the entity's heading measured in the deck plane. Handing it the
 * unconverted world yaw would point the body somewhere the player is not looking.</p>
 *
 * <p>The physics mod transforms the model itself, but only for entities it counts as mounted to a ship;
 * Stellurgy's pilot dummy is not one, and a walking crew member is not one either, so nothing fights this.
 * {@code require = 0} keeps a render mod that rewrites the method from aborting the mixin config.</p>
