/**
 * Mixin config plugin for {@code mixins.stellurgy.json}.
 *
 * <p>Its only job: gate the three per-dimension WorldInfo mixins
 * ({@link MixinWorldServerMulti} wrapper install, {@code MixinWorldServer}
 * per-dim time / sleep, {@link MixinPlayerList} weather sync) on the
 * {@code perDimWorldInfo} MASTER config flag, so that with the per-dimension
 * WorldInfo subsystem turned off those mixins are never woven into their target
 * classes at all — not merely no-ops at runtime. The other mixins (gravity,
 * atmosphere block-place, rocket inventory access) are unrelated and always
 * apply.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Timing.</b> The config is read EAGERLY, once, in {@link #onLoad} during
 * the coremod phase; only the per-target <em>consultation</em>
 * ({@link #shouldApplyMixin}) is lazy, as each target class first loads
 * ({@code WorldServerMulti} at dimension creation, {@code PlayerList} at server
 * start). The snapshot is therefore frozen for the life of the JVM. We read the
 * {@code .cfg} directly rather than going through
 * {@link dev.stannismod.stellurgy.api.StellurgyConfiguration}, because that
 * singleton is populated in mod pre-init, which runs AFTER the coremod phase
 * that constructs this plugin — at {@code onLoad} time there is no loaded
 * config to ask.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Fail-open.</b> If the config can't be read for any reason (missing
 * file on first launch, parse error), we default to {@code true} — i.e. the
 * WorldInfo mixins apply, exactly as they did before this plugin existed. A
 * disabled-by-accident subsystem would be a worse surprise than the
 * pre-existing always-on behaviour. Two of the three gated mixins additionally
 * re-check the flag at runtime, so a fail-open weave leaves them inert rather
 * than active; {@code MixinPlayerList} is the exception. Which branch fired is
 * logged, because a gate stuck open is otherwise invisible.</p>
