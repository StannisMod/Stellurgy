/**
 * Computes the BLOCK paste-Y for a descent crossing into a real planet dimension, so the pasted VS
 * ship sits <b>above</b> the destination terrain and <b>under</b> the vanilla build height.
 *
 * <p>The ceiling clamp is not cosmetic. A crossing pastes the ship into clear sky and then lets VS's
 * {@code FIND_ALL_BLOCKS} flood-fill re-discover it; a paste that clips at the build height (Y=256)
 * splits the ship's block set and the flood-fill grabs only part of it, so the re-assembled physo is
 * wrong. The paste-Y therefore has two hard bounds: it must clear the terrain top (or the ship spawns
 * buried) and it must leave the whole ship height below {@link #MAX_BUILD_Y}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link CellWorldMapper} POSES (which use the ~2M honest range with no height cap), descent
 * lands on a real planet whose blocks live in the ordinary 0..{@link #MAX_BUILD_Y} band, so the two
 * bounds can genuinely conflict: a ship taller than the gap between the terrain and the build ceiling
 * cannot fit here at all. In that case {@link #pasteY} returns {@code -1} and the caller aborts the
 * descent rather than pasting a clipped ship.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Status.</b> {@link #MAX_BUILD_Y} is this class's live contribution — it is the single owner of
 * "the top of the vanilla block band", and the descent paste band is derived from it. The terrain-fit
 * pair ({@link #pasteY} and {@link #terrainTopOfFootprint}) has no production caller any more: a
 * descent arrives in the AIR over the destination and the pilot flies it down, so no ground fit is
 * computed and no descent is refused for not fitting one. The pair is kept, with its tests, for a
 * future mechanic that genuinely needs to place a structure on a surface.</p>
