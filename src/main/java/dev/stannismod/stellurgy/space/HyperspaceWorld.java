/**
 * The single, permanent, shared <b>hyperspace world</b> that holds every tier-2 ship in transit
 * ("transit hosting"). Unlike the pool {@linkplain SpaceSlotPool slots} it is never
 * rebound or evicted - it is registered once and force-kept-loaded, so parked ships keep ticking (their
 * TEs run, passengers walk) for the whole transit. Ships are spaced across it by {@link HyperspaceTiles}
 * so they never see or collide with one another.
 *
 * <p><b>It is DURABLE.</b> Its chunks and the physics mod's own per-world ship registry live in a
 * folder named after the world rather than after the per-boot dimension id
 * ({@code SpaceSlotPool#hyperspaceSubfolder}), so a ship parked here is still parked here after the
 * server has stopped and started again — the id it lands on next boot is free to differ. Two things
 * follow, and both are load-bearing: a restored jump ADOPTS the hull standing in its lane instead of
 * pasting a copy at the far end, and every hull no record claims has to be collected at boot, or an
 * abandoned one would hold its lane for the life of the save. {@code HyperspaceSurvivesARestartE2ETest}
 * is the witness for both.</p>
 *
 * <p>Registered upfront by {@link #register()} (a cheap Forge map entry, mirroring the slot pool) with
 * the void {@link WorldProviderSpaceSlot} provider (an all-air world - the transit lanes are the only
 * content); the world itself is loaded lazily by {@link #getOrCreate()} on the first transit. Server main
 * thread only.</p>
