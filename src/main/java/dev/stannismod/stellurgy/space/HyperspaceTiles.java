 * client animation and {@link ShipTransit} advances the ship's coordinate logically, so the parked
 * ships never physically move and must simply not overlap.
 *
 * <p>Tiles are laid out on a square spiral (the same shape {@code SpaceObjectManager} uses for
 * stations) with adjacent lanes {@link #SPACING_BLOCKS} apart - 2048 blocks = 128 chunks, beyond both
 * the modded render ceiling (~64 chunks) and the ~512-block player entity-tracking range, so riders
 * never see, collide with, or track across ships on pure vanilla mechanics. The void between lanes is
 * never chunk-loaded, so spacing is near-free and capacity is effectively unbounded.</p>
 *
 * <p>Pure and server-main-thread only: hands out and recycles integer indices and maps each to a
 * world {@link BlockPos}. Freed indices are reused (lowest-first) to keep the used region compact.</p>
