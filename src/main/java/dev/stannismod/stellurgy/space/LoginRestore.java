/**
 * The <b>login restore decision</b> for a player who logged out aboard a tier-2 ship: given his
 * durable aboard-tag and the ship ledger, decide which dimension and position he must be placed in
 * before the server hands him a world.
 *
 * <p>This is deliberately a PURE decision surface. It answers "where does he go", it does not move
 * anybody: the caller performs the placement. Everything that would need a live server — reading the
 * ledger, materializing a cell, unpacking a parked transit, querying a ship's live pose, reading a
 * bed spawn — sits behind the {@link Ops} seam, which is addressed by <i>dimension id</i> and
 * <i>UUID</i> only and never by a {@code World} type. That is what makes the whole decision table
 * unit-testable with no Minecraft server at all (the {@link ShipCrossingService.Ops} precedent).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the ledger outranks the tag.</b> The tag is written when the player sits down and
 * travels in his player file; it is a snapshot of where the ship was <i>when he left</i>. The ship
 * itself may have kept flying under another crew member the whole time he was offline, so
 * {@code tag.coord} can be arbitrarily stale. Whenever the ledger knows the ship, the ledger's
 * coordinate is the one that is used and the tag's coordinate is treated as a diagnostic only. The
 * tag's real payload is the ship <i>identity</i> and the seat offset.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Totality.</b> {@link #resolve} never returns {@code null} and never throws — not for a
 * missing tag, not for a hostile {@link Ops}, not for an exhausted slot pool. It runs inside the
 * login path, where an escaping exception does not degrade a feature, it prevents the player from
 * joining at all. Every failure therefore collapses into the orphan fallback (personal spawn, else
 * the overworld spawn) with a {@link Reason} that says why, so the outcome is loggable and
 * observable rather than silent.</p>
 *
 * <p>Server main thread only.</p>
 *
 * Every static field of this type is effectively final, process lifetime: built once at class initialisation.
