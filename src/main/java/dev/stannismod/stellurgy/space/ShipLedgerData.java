 * ship is — its {@link GalacticCoord}, and nothing else about its whereabouts — together with the
 * subsystem's own clock, which is WHEN everything else in here was true.
 *
 * <p>The slot dimension is deliberately NOT persisted. Slot ids are minted in registration order each
 * start and re-used as cells come and go, so an id written on one boot names a different cell (or no
 * world at all) on the next. Writing one down would be writing down an answer that expires with the
 * process: the coordinate is what survives, and {@link SpaceManager#slotDimOf} re-derives the
 * dimension from it once the cell is materialized again.</p>
 *
 * <p>Hosting + accessor mirror {@code UniverseRegistry} exactly: a {@link WorldSavedData} on the
 * overworld global {@link MapStorage}, server-side only, persisted by MC whenever it is {@code
 * markDirty()}-ed. A ship is stored in exactly one of two places — {@code ships} while it is settled in
 * a cell, its {@link TransitRecord} (block snapshot included) while it is in flight — and
 * {@link #replaceAll} is the single, all-or-nothing writer that keeps those two halves in step.</p>

     * the second erased every ship that happened to be in flight: the durable record said the fleet was

     * holds every value it is going to write, and then writes all of them.</p>
     *
     * <p>It also enforces what used to be a convention no code checked: a ship the live ledger does NOT
     * call settled has to be carried by a transit record, or this write would store it nowhere. Such a
     * snapshot is REFUSED — nothing is touched, whatever was persisted before still stands, and the
     * ships that would have been dropped are returned so the caller can name them. An empty return
     * means the snapshot was applied.</p>
     *
     * <p>The space clock is deliberately NOT part of this write — see {@link #setClock(long)}. It is
     * monotonic state rather than a snapshot, and it dates stamps that live outside this store
     * entirely, so it must never be rolled back by a pass that declined to replace the fleet.</p>
