/**
 * The automatic hyperspace flight of a ship from its origin toward its target, advanced one server
 * tick at a time. Immutable: {@link #advance(long)} returns the next state, so a caller stores the
 * returned value each tick.
 *
 * <p><b>A flight is a scalar, not a moving point.</b> Both ends are cell NAMES plus an offset inside
 * those cells, and a cell rides the body it belongs to — so the straight line between two absolute
 * positions is not a fixed line at all, and integrating a position along it would be integrating over
 * a grid that does not exist: a distance across cells is defined only at a stated tick, read through
 * both frame origins. What is well-defined is how far the ship has got: the distance is priced once,
 * through both frames, at departure; the flight then counts blocks flown against it. That is also
 * exactly the one shape a mid-transit state is allowed to take — origin name, target name, progress,
 * never a raw absolute whose meaning would depend on when it was written — and nothing else about the
 * position needs to be true, because there is no observer: the ship is parked in hyperspace for the
 * whole trip.</p>
 *
 * <p>Speed / reach / power are ship stats supplied by the caller (per-tick block speed); this type
 * only integrates the motion.</p>
