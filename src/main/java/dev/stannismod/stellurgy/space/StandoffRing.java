 * off, spread the bearing so simultaneous placements do not stack, and never leave the anchor's own
 * cell.</p>

 * <p><b>The cell bound is not a detail.</b> An offset that carries into a neighbouring sector puts

 * about, so {@link GalacticCoord#plusLocalSaturating} is used rather than
 * {@link GalacticCoord#plusLocal}: a placement near a cell face ends slightly closer than asked,
 * which is harmless, instead of somewhere else entirely, which is not.</p>
