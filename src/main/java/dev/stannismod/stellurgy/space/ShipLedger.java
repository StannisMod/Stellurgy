/**
 * The authoritative server-side record of every tier-2 ship known to the space subsystem:
 * {@code shipId -> (galactic coordinate, cell, lifecycle state)}.
 *
 * <p><b>Where a ship is, not which world it is in.</b> The ledger deliberately holds no slot
 * dimension id. A slot id is minted per boot and re-used as cells come and go, so a copy of one
 * stored here would be a cache of {@link SpaceManager}'s cell&rarr;slot map — and a cache that
 * nothing refreshes, since the coordinate can be updated without the binding changing and the
 * binding can change without the coordinate moving. Ask {@link SpaceManager#slotDimOf} for the
 * dimension; it is derived from the coordinate this ledger owns.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Key discipline:</b> the key is the ship's DURABLE id — the UUID minted at tier-2 assembly
 * and persisted in the Advanced Flight Computer's tile NBT (crossings carry tile NBT verbatim, so
 * it survives every jump). The physics mod's own ship UUID is re-minted on every re-assembly and
 * must never key an entry here.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Refcount ownership:</b> a {@link State#SETTLED} entry owns ONE occupant refcount on its
 * cell (the {@link SpaceManager#materialize} the settling performed). Whoever moves the ship out
 * of the cell (a transit departure, a descent) releases that refcount and updates the entry —
 * the ledger records ownership, it does not call the manager itself.</p>
 *
 * <p>In-memory only (rebuilt as ships re-enter); NBT persistence is a follow-up concern. This is
 * the fix for transit-arrival amnesia: an arrived ship's coordinate now lives here instead of
 * being dropped with the finished transit. Server main thread only.</p>
