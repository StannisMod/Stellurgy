/**
 * The one definition of a <b>ship-relative point</b>: a position on a ship expressed as an offset
 * from that ship's flight computer, and the two conversions that carry it to and from the world.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the flight computer.</b> A ship's blocks live in a subspace that is re-minted on every
 * re-assembly — a jump, an entry, a descent — so an absolute subspace coordinate names nothing the
 * moment the ship is rebuilt. The flight computer is the landmark that survives: it rides the
 * relocation with the rest of the ship's blocks, and it is what mints the ship's durable id
 * ({@link TileAdvancedFlightComputer#shipIdOrNull}). A point measured from it is therefore invariant
 * under the rigid relocation, exactly like the seat link offset the crew transfer matches seats by.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the writer and the reader must share this class.</b> The offset is defined against the
 * computer's RAW BLOCK ORIGIN — {@code afcPos.getX()}, not its centre and not any mount-point
 * fudge. A hidden {@code +0.5} on one side of the round trip and not the other is a silent
 * half-block drift per save/load cycle, which is why both directions live here and nowhere else.</p>
 *
 * <p>Server-side in practice. Every method is a safe no-op ({@code null}) when the physics mod is
 * absent, the ship is not loaded, or the computer cannot be found.</p>
