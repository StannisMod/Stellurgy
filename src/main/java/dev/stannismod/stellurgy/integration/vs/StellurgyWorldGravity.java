/**
 * The gravity vector a ship feels in a given world, in the units the physics solver spends.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>The engine applies ONE gravity vector to every craft in every world. A planet's own
 * gravitational multiplier never reached it, so a tier-2 ship felt Earth gravity on the Moon, on a
 * gas giant and in the void of a space cell alike — and the only reason ships did not visibly fall
 * wrong was that the flight controller's feed-forward happened to cancel exactly what the solver was
 * about to add. That is a coincidence holding up a mechanic, not a mechanic.</p>
 *
 * <p>Thrust-to-weight, hover cost, braking authority and stopping distance are all statements ABOUT a
 * gravity field. Until the field varies, none of them can be designed — only invented.</p>
 *
 * <h2>One function, two callers, on purpose</h2>
 *
 * <p>The solver asks this when it applies gravity, and the flight computer asks it when it feeds
 * gravity forward. They MUST agree: the controller cancels what the solver adds, so two answers would
 * make a hovering craft climb or sink by their difference. Correcting gravity in the controller alone
 * was the rejected alternative for exactly this reason — it would leave every hull without a flight
 * computer at Earth gravity, and put the knowledge of what gravity IS in two places.</p>
 *
 * <h2>The three cases</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A space cell</b> — zero. There is nothing to fall towards.</li>
 *   <li><b>A registered Stellurgy world</b> — the configured vector scaled by that body's own
 *       gravitational multiplier, which is the same number the rocket tier has always flown by.</li>
 *   <li><b>Anything else</b> — the configured vector, unchanged. A vanilla or foreign world behaves
 *       exactly as it did before this existed, which is what makes this safe to apply to every craft
 *       rather than only to ours.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Scaling the CONFIGURED vector rather than a constant of our own is deliberate: it keeps one
 * source for what a standard gravity is worth, so the config still means what it says, and any X/Z
 * component somebody sets is carried through instead of silently dropped.</p>
