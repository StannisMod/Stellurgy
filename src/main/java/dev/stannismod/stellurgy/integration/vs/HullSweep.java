/**
 * Collision sweep of a WORLD-axis-aligned body box against a ship's blocks in their TRUE world
 * orientation. The hull-stand mode holds a world-upright body against ship geometry; sweeping a
 * subspace-aligned box instead displaces every contact by {@code h*sin(tilt/2)} — the player then
 * walks "about a block beside the blocks he sees". This class collides the body's REAL volume.
 *
 * <p>Pure math, deliberately free of Minecraft and physics-mod types: obstacles arrive as boxes
 * axis-aligned in the SHIP frame — a world center, half-extents, and the ship's three world-frame
 * axis vectors shared by all of them — and the body as a world AABB. Resolution mirrors vanilla
 * {@code Entity.move}: three sequential single-axis passes (Y, X, Z on WORLD axes), each pass
 * clipping its displacement at the first separating-axis time of impact (15 SAT axes: 3 world,
 * 3 ship, 9 crosses). An obstacle already overlapping the body at the start of a pass does not
 * clip it — vanilla's permissiveness; the bounded start-lift handles shallow embeds instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>"Up" (for the start-lift and step assist) is an INPUT — the opposite of the local gravity —
 * per the stand-vs-slide ruling: the stand/slide threshold must emerge from geometry, step assist
 * and gravity, and in zero gravity ({@code up == null}) neither lift nor step applies.</p>
