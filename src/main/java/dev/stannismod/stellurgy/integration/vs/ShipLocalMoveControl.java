/**
 * Experiment control for taking over {@link Entity#move} on the server for ONE entity.
 *
 * <p>Why this exists: a crew member walking on a rotated ship cannot be collided correctly in the
 * world frame - his box is upright and the deck is not. The ship's blocks, however, also exist
 * unrotated and axis-aligned in the ship's own subspace, so his movement can be resolved there with
 * ordinary rules and mapped back. The physics mod already claims {@code Entity.move} at HEAD
 * (cancellably) to do its own world-frame resolution, so Stellurgy must run first and suppress it.</p>
 *
 * <p>The modes exist to keep the two questions separable:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Mode#OBSERVE} - fire, change nothing. Proves the injection exists (a failed
 *       {@code @Inject} is silent in a dev workspace).</li>
 *   <li>{@link Mode#CANCEL} - fire and cancel. Proves Stellurgy runs before the physics mod, because a
 *       cancelled callback suppresses every callback queued behind it.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Mode#SHIP_FRAME} - fire, resolve movement in the ship's frame, cancel. The real path.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Inert by default</b>, then only for the one entity id it was given, and only server-side.
 * All state is {@code volatile}: written from a command thread, read on the server tick.</p>
