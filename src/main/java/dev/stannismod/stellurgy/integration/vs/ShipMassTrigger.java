/**
 * Recomputes a ship's mass from its hull at the moments where the incremental path cannot be trusted
 * to have kept up, and records it whenever the two disagree.
 *
 * <h2>Why these moments and no others</h2>
 *
 * <p>The incremental path — a delta applied as each block changes — is the working answer and stays
 * so. A full pass over the hull is justified only where something happened that the deltas were never
 * shown:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Assembled.</b> The craft was fed to the accumulator block by block moments ago. The
 *       recompute here is not a repair; it is the independent second opinion that makes a
 *       disagreement detectable at all, and this is the one case where the two really ought to
 *       agree.</li>
 *   <li><b>Pasted.</b> A craft cut out of one world and re-registered around blocks somewhere else.
 *       Same shape as an assembly and the same reason.</li>
 *   <li><b>Loaded.</b> The record came off disk carrying a number of unknown provenance — written by
 *       some earlier version, possibly by a build with a different table. This is the one transition
 *       where a disagreement is not a defect but the entire reason to recompute, so it is applied
 *       WITHOUT being reported.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately NOT on a timer and NOT on a positional probe. Before the engine names a ship its
 * blocks are already loaded and ticking at shipyard addresses no player can reach; a frame computed
 * in that window is a frame about a craft that does not exist yet. Arming on the naming announcement
 * is what makes "named" a precondition by construction rather than by a check somebody can forget.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Drift is recorded, never corrected quietly, and never thrown</h2>
 *
 * <p>A disagreement on an assembly or a paste means a trigger is missing somewhere, and the repair is
 * that trigger. Substituting the right number silently would turn the safety net into normal
 * operation and destroy the only signal that anything is wrong — so the authoritative frame is
 * written AND the disagreement is kept, with its sign, for a test to assert on.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is kept rather than thrown because this runs inside the world tick, from an event whose
 * contract forbids a handler to throw: an exception here leaves the tick with nothing between it and
 * the server loop, and a dead server reports "the process exited", not "the mass drifted by 4%". A
 * failure nobody can read is not a louder failure.</p>
