/**
 * Resolves one tick of an aboard entity's movement in its SHIP's frame instead of the world's.
 *
 * <p>The problem it solves: Minecraft's collision box is axis-aligned by definition and an entity
 * has no roll, so an upright box can never be oriented to a rolled deck. But the ship's blocks also
 * exist, unrotated and axis-aligned, in the ship's own subspace. Map the entity there and the deck is
 * flat, "down" is plain {@code -Y}, and the entity's box is deck-aligned for free - ordinary
 * collision then does the right thing. Map the result back and the world sees a body that stands on
 * a tilted floor.</p>
 *
 * <p>The entity's ship-frame position is the AUTHORITATIVE one; its world position is derived from
 * it through the ship transform on every tick. That single choice is what makes the entity ride a
 * moving, rotating ship: when the transform changes, the derived world position follows, with no
 * separate "drag" step.</p>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately incomplete (this is the mechanism, not the finished feature): no step assist, no
 * block-collision callbacks, no fall damage, no walking-frame input. It returns {@code false}
 * whenever it cannot do the job, and the caller must then let vanilla movement run.</p>
