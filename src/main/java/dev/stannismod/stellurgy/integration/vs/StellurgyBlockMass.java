/**
 * The structural mass of one block, in kilograms, for the physics engine to accumulate.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists at all, and why it applies to EVERY craft</h2>
 *
 * <p>The engine decides a block's mass in exactly one place, from a flat table keyed on the block
 * alone: a full fuel tank masses what an empty one does, and a blockstate carries no information.
 * Stellurgy already owns a per-block table denominated in kilograms that the rocket tier has used for years,
 * and it is strictly better informed. So this replaces that one lookup rather than reimplementing the
 * accumulation around it — the smearing that keeps a tensor invertible and the parallel-axis
 * bookkeeping that follows a moving centre of mass are the engine's, are correct, and stay.</p>
 *
 * <p>The rule applies to every physics object, not only to craft Stellurgy assembled. A mass model that
 * answered differently depending on who built the hull would be two mass models, and the point is
 * that there is one. It costs nothing worth keeping: the only force-providing block in the tree
 * computes its force by multiplying BY the craft's mass, so it is invariant under any mass model.</p>
 *
 * <h2>What is NOT answered here</h2>
 *
 * <p>Tile contents — fluids and inventories — cannot be seen from a blockstate, and a blockstate is
 * all this receives. Sampling them belongs to the cadence that runs for craft which have a flight
 * computer, so a foreign hull gets honest structural mass without paying for inventory tracking.
 * Crew likewise: a body is not a block.</p>
