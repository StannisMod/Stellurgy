/**
 * The authoritative answer to "what does this hull actually weigh": one pass over every block the
 * ship owns, priced from Stellurgy's own table.
 *
 * <h2>Authority, not the working path</h2>
 *
 * <p>The engine keeps a ship's mass, centre of mass and inertia tensor as an ACCUMULATOR that lives
 * from the craft's birth: it is fed block by block when the hull is first relocated, adjusted per
 * block for the rest of the ship's life, and restored from disk on a world load. The hull is never
 * rescanned. That incremental path is cheap and correct as long as nothing is ever missed, and it
 * stays the working path.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is the other half: a full recompute, run where it is independently justified rather
 * than on a timer — the craft has just been assembled, or pasted somewhere else, or brought back from
 * disk. Its answer is what a disagreement is measured AGAINST, which is the whole reason it exists:
 * a drift between the two is a missing trigger, and without an independent number nothing could
 * notice one.</p>
 *
 * <h2>The frame this answers in</h2>
 *
 * <p>The engine's record is expressed in the ship's own SUBSPACE address space — the shipyard the
 * craft's blocks really live in, which for a real ship starts past five million blocks along X. A
 * frame computed in any other origin would disagree with the record by that whole offset and every
 * comparison would report drift forever, so the answer here is in exactly that space.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is not ACCUMULATED there, though. Second moments about a point five million away are ~10^13
 * per kilogram before the shift back to the centre of mass cancels almost all of it, which spends
 * most of a double's 15 significant digits on a constant. Measured against the tolerances the writer
 * compares with, the direct form is still inside them — but the fix is one subtraction, so the walk
 * happens about a point near the hull and the frame is translated back at the end. The inertia tensor
 * is about the centre of mass and unaffected by where it was measured from.</p>
 *
 * <h2>All three halves, in one pass</h2>
 *
 * <p>Structure, CONTENT (fluids and inventories, which no block state reveals) and CREW (the people
 * the deck is carrying, with what they carry). They are measured together because the engine's record
 * holds ONE mass: the moment the written number includes content, a structure-only recompute compared
 * against it would report the fuel in the tanks as drift, every time. One composition, written and
 * compared, or the safety net cries wolf about the ordinary case.</p>
